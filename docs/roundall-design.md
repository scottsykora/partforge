# `roundAll(r)` — portable whole-solid rounding

Status: **proposed** (design approved in session, not yet implemented)
Date: 2026-08-16
Base: **stacked on PR #133** (native mesh fillet/chamfer, contract v3).
Spike: session worktree `spike/` scripts (throwaway); findings summarized below.

## Summary

`Solid.roundAll(r)` rounds **every** edge of a solid — convex and concave — with
radius ≈ r, by morphological *close-then-open*: dilate by `r`, erode by `2r`,
dilate by `r`, with a ball. It is implemented natively on **both** backends and
never routes: parts using it keep fast Manifold previews, and STEP export still
gets true B-rep arc surfaces (in the regime where OCCT can produce them — see
the conformance split).

### Relationship to mesh fillet (#133)

`meshFillet`/`meshChamfer` are the **selective** tools: constant radius on
chosen edges, restricted to the edge classes `mesh-fillet.js` can chain
(straight and circular-arc), rerouting anything else to OCCT via
`NEEDS_OCCT`. `roundAll` is the **global** complement: no edge selection, but
it handles arbitrary curved edge chains, blends convex and concave in one
pass, and consumes sub-radius features. Their failure directions are
opposite — for unsupported cases mesh fillet falls back *to* OCCT, while
`roundAll`'s capable backend *is* the mesh one, so it must never throw
`NEEDS_OCCT` (rerouting would land on the weaker implementation).

Semantics inherited from morphology, not from edge dressup:

- Faces stay in place; overall dimensions are preserved for features larger
  than `r`.
- Convex edges/corners round at radius `r` (spherical at corners); concave
  edges fillet at radius `r`.
- Features smaller than the ball are **consumed**: walls/ribs thinner than
  `2r` disappear, holes/slots narrower than `2r` seal shut. This is the point
  of the op — "melt the whole part smooth by r" — and also its sharp edge:
  there is no edge selection and no per-edge radius. For selective filleting
  use `fillet` (OCCT) or the planned wedge-fillet subset (separate track).

## API

```js
s.roundAll(2)            // scalar form
s.roundAll({ r: 2 })     // options form (op-options normalization, like fillet)
```

- `r` must be a finite number ≥ 0. `r === 0` is the identity on every backend
  (same provably-zero carve-out as `fillet(0)`; extend `isZeroMagnitudeCadOp`'s
  spirit but NOT that function — `roundAll` is not a CAD op and never routes).
- Added to `SOLID_OPS` in `kernel.js`; **not** added to `OCCT_ONLY_OPS` (both
  backends must implement it — no stub) and **not** to `ROUTED_CAD_OPS` (the
  probe records it as an ordinary solid op; routing is unaffected).
- `CONTRACT_VERSION` bumps 3 → 4 on top of #133's bump.
  `test/kernel-contract.test.js` and `docs/KERNEL-CONTRACT.md` get the new row.

No quality parameter in v1: quality follows the kernel's existing
preview/print tier, like every other curved primitive. (If a part ever needs
control, an options field can be added compatibly.)

## Contract (KERNEL-CONTRACT.md wording)

`roundAll` is **parity-tolerant**, not backend-identical, with an explicit
regime split:

1. **Safe regime — `r` strictly below the solid's smallest local feature size**
   (min wall thickness, min hole diameter / 2, min edge-to-edge clearance):
   both backends produce the morphological result; volumes agree within the
   mesh-tolerance band (spike: ≤ 0.05% on box and L-bracket cases). This is
   the only regime with cross-backend parity promises.
2. **Consuming regime — `r` at or above feature size**: the **core (mesh)
   class** performs true consumption (features melt away; small remnant
   ridges at consumed-feature bases are correct morphology, not defects).
   The **B-rep class** attempts the same result but MAY skip the entire op
   (returning the input unchanged, with a `roundall-skipped` warning) when
   the offset machinery cannot produce a valid solid. A B-rep `roundAll`
   must never emit an invalid or semantically wrong solid — skip is the only
   permitted degrade (mirror of the fillet skip-on-failure policy).

Authors are pointed at a `verify`-block volume assertion as the guardrail
when they rely on consumption (e.g. `volume` delta bounds), and at the rule
of thumb: keep `r` below half your thinnest wall unless you *want* melting.

## Manifold implementation

`src/framework/geometry/manifold-backend.js`, on the wrapped solid:

```
m1 = simplify(m.minkowskiSum(sphere(r, segs)))
m2 = simplify(m1.minkowskiDifference(sphere(2r, segs)))
out = simplify(m2.minkowskiSum(sphere(r, segs)))
```

- **`simplify` between steps is mandatory, not an optimization.** The naive
  Minkowski (hull-of-triangle-pairs) emits sliver-degenerate meshes whose
  complexity explodes through the chain: the spike's torture case went from
  106 s / 761k tris / broken topology without simplify to 2.4 s / 340 tris /
  clean genus with it. Simplify tolerance: `max(r / 100, 0.01)` mm — well
  under mesh display tolerance, tight enough to preserve the arcs.
- **Sphere segments scale with quality tier and radius**: choose `segs` so
  chord sagitta `r · (1 − cos(π/segs))` stays under the tier's tolerance
  (preview ≈ 0.05 mm, print ≈ 0.01 mm), clamped to [12, 64]. At r = 2 mm
  preview that lands ≈ 15 segs (~0.04 mm sagitta). (`mesh-fillet.js` uses the
  same sagitta *formula* for its burial epsilons but takes full-circle
  `SEGS[quality]` for tessellation — Minkowski cost makes that unaffordable
  here, so `roundAll` owns its radius-scaled `roundAllSegs` helper.) Facets
  smooth-shade in the viewer via the creased-normals pass; only silhouettes
  reveal them.
- **Never throws `NEEDS_OCCT`.** The runtime reroute latch exists for ops the
  mesh backend can't do; for `roundAll` the mesh backend is the reference
  implementation, and rerouting would trade a correct result for a skip.
- Cost is real but bounded: hundreds of ms to a few seconds on non-convex
  parts, comparable to an OCCT-routed part today, and memoized by content
  hash like every op — it re-runs only when upstream params change.
- Cache key: `h("roundAll", hash, r)` (segs/tolerance derive from quality and
  radius, so they don't need to be in the key; quality is already part of the
  kernel identity).

## OCCT implementation

`src/framework/geometry/occt-backend.js` + a new policy in `occt-repair.js`:

Triple offset via raw OCCT (`replicad.getOC()`), since replicad has no solid
offset wrapper: `BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffsetShape.PerformByJoin(shape, off, 1e-6,
BRepOffset_Skin, intersection, false, join, false, progressRange)`.

Each step runs a **variant cascade**, first success wins:

| order | join | intersection |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GeomAbs_Arc` | `false` |
| 2 | `GeomAbs_Arc` | `true` |
| 3 | `GeomAbs_Intersection` | `false` |
| 4 | `GeomAbs_Intersection` | `true` |

(The spike needed exactly this spread: plain solids dilate with arc/false,
the chained erosion only succeeds with arc/true, and concave post-boolean
solids only dilate with intersection join — which is morphologically fine,
because the *final* arc dilation supplies the convex rounding.)

A step's candidate is accepted only if it passes ALL of:

1. `IsDone()` and non-null shape;
2. meshes to a closed solid with finite positive volume;
3. **monotonicity**: dilation must not shrink volume, erosion must not grow
   it (catches OCCT's "successful" garbage — the spike saw an erosion return
   volume 54 from a 12 000 mm³ input, and a hole case "complete" with an 11%
   crater error; both are filtered by this gate).

If any step exhausts the cascade, the whole op **skips**: return the input
solid unchanged and `console.warn("roundall-skipped", …)` — same shape as the
fillet `safeOp` policy, same rationale (OCCT offset failures are not
monotonic in `r`; searching for a "largest working radius" would converge on
garbage). Zero-radius short-circuits to a clone before any of this.

Result wrapping reuses the normal `wrap(...)` path with cache key
`h("roundAll", hash, r)`; labels pass through unchanged (`cloneLabels`), same
as fillet — `roundAll` produces new surfaces, so feature-label attribution
uses the fallback path (AUTHORING-PARTS.md §labels note applies).

Known hard limitation (documented, not worked around): OCCT cannot do
feature-consuming morphology. Intersection-join dilation of a sub-`r`-featured
solid can pass `BRepCheck_Analyzer` and still poison every downstream op (all
erosion variants fail; booleans can hard-abort the WASM module). Healing
(`ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain`), step-splitting, and complement-based erosion
were all tried in the spike and none survives; the skip policy is the honest
degrade. **Corollary: never run downstream booleans on a candidate that
failed the acceptance gate.**

## What this does NOT change

- #133's landscape stands: `fillet`/`chamfer` stay mesh-native for straight
  and circular-arc chains with the `NEEDS_OCCT` reroute for the rest; `shell`
  stays the only `ROUTED_CAD_OPS` entry; the probe and backend-select are
  untouched by this design.
- No new worker protocol, no new job types: `roundAll` is an ordinary solid op
  inside `build`.
- `roundedBox` / `roundedCylinder` / Shape2D fillet / `meshFillet` remain the
  precise, selective rounding tools; `roundAll` is the blunt global one.

## Testing

- **Contract**: new `SOLID_OPS` row + version bump held by
  `test/kernel-contract.test.js`.
- **Manifold unit tests** (`test/roundall.test.js`): box volume matches the
  analytic closed form (edge/corner terms, spike reference 5800 ± tier
  tolerance); L-shape concave seam rounds (volume drop vs sharp union);
  consumption: rib melts (bbox height returns to base), d < 2r hole seals
  (genus 1 → 0); r = 0 identity; result watertight (`genus`/`isEmpty` sane).
- **OCCT tests** (own file — OCCT boots alone): box + L-shape volumes match
  the Manifold references within 0.5%; the consuming case exercises the skip
  path (result === input volume, warning emitted); r = 0 identity.
- **Parity fixture**: extend the cross-backend volume comparison the same way
  existing parity-tolerant ops are held (box/L-shape only — consuming cases
  are explicitly out of parity scope).
- **ERROR-PATTERNS.md**: one new pattern — `roundall-skipped` → radius likely
  at/above local feature size → reduce r, or accept mesh-only consumption.

## Rollout

1. Kernel op + Manifold implementation + tests (includes the `SOLID_OP_SPECS`
   entry in `op-options.js` — `roundAll: { toArgs: {r} → [r] }` — so the
   options form normalizes and `lint`'s validating probe accepts both forms).
2. OCCT cascade + repair policy + tests.
3. KERNEL-CONTRACT.md (version 4), AUTHORING-PARTS.md section, ERROR-PATTERNS
   entry.
4. Demo part or planter variant exercising it (optional, follow-up).
5. Version bump in the PR per release process.

## Open questions (deliberately deferred)

- Exposing one-sided variants (`roundConvex` / `roundConcave` via opening-only
  or closing-only) — trivial to add later on both implementation paths; YAGNI
  until a part needs it.
- A `minFeature` pre-check on the OCCT side (via the oracle's min-wall
  machinery) to *predict* skips instead of discovering them — nice diagnostics,
  not needed for correctness.
