# The partforge kernel contract

**Contract version: 2** (introduced in partforge 0.59) — mirrored by `CONTRACT_VERSION`
in `src/framework/geometry/kernel.js` and asserted by `test/kernel-contract.test.js`;
see [Versioning](#versioning) for what may change under which version bump.

This document is the portable seam of partforge. A part's `build(k, p, d)` is a pure ESM
function written against the kernel `k` and the `Solid` handles it returns — no framework
imports, no DOM, no backend types. That means **the kernel interface is the interchange
format**: any host that implements this contract can run any partforge part, and an LLM
given this document plus one exemplar part has everything it needs to write correct
geometry. There is deliberately no separate file format or DSL.

The contract has two halves:

- **Machine-checked:** the op lists in `src/framework/geometry/kernel.js`
  (`KERNEL_OPS`, `SOLID_OPS`, `OCCT_ONLY_OPS`, `*_OPTIONAL_OPS`) and their `@typedef`
  signatures. `test/kernel-contract.test.js` and the OCCT twin in
  `test/occt-backend.test.js` assert each backend exposes exactly these ops, so the list
  cannot silently drift from the implementations. **Those lists are normative.**
- **Prose (this doc):** the semantics an implementer or generator cannot read off a
  signature — coordinate conventions, value semantics, validation rules, error taxonomy,
  what parts may and may not rely on across backends.

Audience: backend/host implementers, and anyone (human or LLM) generating parts outside
this repo. For *authoring guidance* — usage tables, worked snippets, control-panel schema
— read `docs/AUTHORING-PARTS.md`. Where the two overlap (the op tables), this doc
carries the conformance semantics and that one the usage guidance;
`test/kernel-contract.test.js` keeps this doc's op coverage in sync with the code.

## Conformance classes

**Core class.** A conforming core kernel implements every op in `KERNEL_OPS` and
every `Solid` op in `SOLID_OPS`, *except* that the B-rep ops (`fillet`, `chamfer`,
`shell` — the `OCCT_ONLY_OPS` list — and `toSTEP`) may instead throw
`KernelCapabilityError`. Exception to the exception: `fillet(0)` / `chamfer({d: 0})`
(a magnitude that is exactly the number `0`, either calling convention) is the
**identity** on every class — it returns the solid unchanged and must not throw, so a
parametric radius dialed to 0 builds on a core kernel with no guard in the part.
`shell` has no identity form (`t: 0` means zero-thickness walls — degenerate, not
identity) and always throws on core. The in-repo Manifold backend is the reference
core kernel. Kernels built from this repo get the stubs for free: `addSugar()`
generates the Solid-level stubs (including the zero-magnitude identity) from
`OCCT_ONLY_OPS`, and `finishKernel()` stubs `toSTEP` (a kernel-level op, so it is
not in that Solid-op list).

**B-rep class.** Core plus native `fillet`/`chamfer`/`shell` and `toSTEP`. The in-repo
OCCT/replicad backend is the reference.

**Optional ops.** `KERNEL_OPTIONAL_OPS` (`beginSubPart`/`endSubPart`/`sweepCache`/
`cacheStats`/`resetCacheStats`/`cleanup`) and `SOLID_OPTIONAL_OPS` (`genus`/`isEmpty`) may
be omitted entirely; callers in the framework guard with `?.`/`typeof`. A host that omits
them loses sub-part caching and mesh-topology gates (`holes`, emptiness), nothing else.
`sweepCache()` is the cache's rebind hygiene hook: called once when a worker is rebound to
a part (never inside a `beginSubPart`/`endSubPart` bracket), it drops cache partitions that
have gone unbuilt for three consecutive rebinds.

`KernelCapabilityError` is a *routing signal*, not a failure: partforge's geometry-free
probe (`probe.js`) runs `build` against a fake kernel, and any use of an `OCCT_ONLY_OPS`
op **on a Solid handle** routes the build to a B-rep-class kernel (the probe tracks
handle kinds, so the same names on a `Shape2D` — shared pure JS, backend-identical — do
not route). Routing granularity is a host choice: the in-repo framework routes preview
builds per sub-part (each sub-part builds wholly on one kernel) and exports/CLI whole-
part; a single-kernel host routes everything whole-part. A host with only a core kernel
must surface the error ("this part needs a B-rep backend") rather than swallow it.

## Global semantics

These hold for every op on every backend. A part may assume them; an implementation must
provide them.

- **Units are millimetres.** Everywhere, including `volume()` (mm³) and mesh output.
- **Angles are degrees.** Everywhere (`rotate*`, `twist`, `revolve` `degrees`, loft ring
  `rotate`, `arcDeg` helpers).
- **Coordinates are right-handed, Z-up.** Primitives build along **+Z from z = 0**
  (`cylinder`, `prism`, `extrude` extrude upward; `revolve` spins `[[r, z], …]` about the
  Z axis). The idiom is *build canonical at the origin, then orient/place*
  (`.along(dir).at(v)`).
- **2-D contours are `[[x, y], …]` point lists, CCW = material.** Holes in an `extrude`
  profile are additional contours; winding of holes is normalized by the backend. The
  symbolic-arc alternative is an **arc profile** `{ start, segments: [{ to, via? }, …] }`
  (produced by `roundedProfile`), where a segment with `via` is a three-point circular
  arc; B-rep backends must carry these arcs exactly (real CIRCLE edges in STEP), mesh
  backends tessellate them. Cubic Bézier segments (`{to, c1, c2}`, built via `pathProfile().cubicTo(…)`)
  follow the same rule: exact spline B-rep on OCCT (→ STEP), adaptively faceted at
  the mesh `segs` LOD on Manifold. Measure-parity (volume/bbox) holds within
  tolerance as facets converge; this is not a parity waiver.
- **Ops never mutate — but they MAY consume.** Every op returns a new `Solid` and never
  mutates one in place. Whether the *inputs stay valid* is backend-dependent: the mesh
  backend leaves them usable, but the B-rep backend's engine (replicad) deletes the
  operand of a transform or boolean. The portable rule is therefore: **never reuse a
  `Solid` after passing it to a transform or boolean — `.clone()` first if you need it
  again** (failure signature: ERROR-PATTERNS.md `replicad-consumed-operand`). `clone()`
  must return an independent handle on every backend; a backend MAY additionally provide
  full value semantics, but a portable part must not rely on it.
- **Purity and determinism: identical arguments must produce identical geometry.** No
  randomness, clocks, or hidden global state in an implementation. partforge's solid
  cache memoizes by a content hash of `(op, args)`; a nondeterministic op silently
  poisons the cache.
- **Validation** (a conforming implementation enforces all of these; in-repo the kernel
  front checks the `prism`/`extrude`/`revolve` rules, `addSugar` the `scale` rule, and
  the B-rep backend the `shell` rule): `prism`/`extrude` `scaleTop ≥ 0`; `revolve`
  profile radii `≥ 0`; `scale` `factor > 0`; `shell` requires `open` (a fully
  closed hollow is not supported).
- **Error taxonomy:** invalid arguments throw plain `Error` with a message naming the op
  (`"prism: scaleTop must be ≥ 0"`); a whole op a backend class lacks throws
  `KernelCapabilityError` (from `geometry/errors.js`) — the routing signal. A
  backend-divergent *option* (`loft`/`sweep` `closed: true` on a B-rep kernel) throws a
  plain `Error` naming the limitation, not `KernelCapabilityError`: option misuse is not
  reroutable, and a host must fail loudly rather than silently ignore the option. Beyond
  those, nothing else is thrown for well-formed input — a fillet the engine cannot
  compute falls under the repair policy below, not a part-visible error class.

## Calling convention

**Detection rule (normative):** a call is **options form** when the op receives
**exactly one argument and it is a plain object** — not an `Array`, not a `Solid`.
Any other arity or first argument is legacy positional form. "Plain object" means
`Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === Object.prototype || null`, which excludes arrays,
`Solid` handles (backend handles carry methods/prototypes), and typed arrays. This
one rule disambiguates every op with no key-sniffing — the load-bearing case:
`extrude({outer, holes}, h)` is positional (two arguments); `extrude({profile, h})`
is options (one plain object).

Options form is canonical — the form this document, `AUTHORING-PARTS.md`, and every
in-repo part teach and use. Legacy positional forms remain accepted (silently — no
runtime warning) until a future breaking contract version removes them; a conforming
implementation must accept both, and this repo's `finishKernel()`/`addSugar()`
provide the normalization for free. (Contract v2, partforge 0.59, did **not** remove
them — that bump was for `offset` semantics, see [Versioning](#versioning); legacy
positional removal is still pending a version of its own.)

### Kernel factory ops (options-canonical; legacy positional accepted)

| Op | Canonical options form | Legacy positional (pending removal) |
|---|---|---|
| `cylinder` | `{r\|d, h, center?}` straight · `{r1, r2, h, center?}` or `{d1, d2, h, center?}` cone | `(rBottom, rTop, h, {center?})` |
| `sphere` | `{r\|d}` — `sphere(5)` stays valid, undeprecated | `(r)` |
| `box` | `{size:[x,y,z], center?}` (centered X/Y, base z=0; `center:true` also centers Z) · `{min, max}` | `(min, max)` |
| `prism` | `{points, h, twist?, scaleTop?}` | `(points2D, h, {twist?,scaleTop?})` |
| `extrude` | `{profile, h, twist?, scaleTop?, bevel?}` — `profile` = points array, `{outer, holes}`, or arc profile; `bevel` has no positional form | `(profile, h, {twist?,scaleTop?})` |
| `revolve` | `{profile, degrees?}` | `(points2D, {degrees?})` |
| `loft` | `{rings, ruled?, closed?}` | `(rings, {ruled?,closed?})` |
| `sweep` | `{profile, path, closed?, cornerRadius?, ruled?, smooth?}` | `(profile2D, path3D, opts?)` |

`boredCylinder`, `helixSweptTube` and `screwSweep` were always options-only (no
positional legacy form exists); they get the same unknown-key / required-key
validation as the ops above.
`union(solids[])` and `toSTEP(named[])` take a single array — unchanged.

### Solid ops

| Op | Canonical form(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fillet` | `fillet(3)` · `fillet({r, edges?})` | options form replaces `fillet(3, selector)` |
| `chamfer` | `chamfer(1)` · `chamfer({d, edges?})` | ditto |
| `shell` | `shell({t, open})` | replaces `(thickness, openFaces)`; `open` was already required |
| everything else | unchanged | `translate/at/along/rotate*/rotateAbout/mirror/scale/cut/cutAll/intersect/union/clone/label` + queries |

### Cylinder key rules

- Straight: exactly one of `r` / `d`. Cone: `r1`+`r2` or `d1`+`d2` (no mixing
  radius and diameter across ends; no mixing straight and cone keys).
- `h` required everywhere.
- Diameter keys are sugar: normalized to radii before the backend sees them.

### `box({size})` placement

`{size:[x,y,z]}` is centered in X and Y with its base at `z = 0` — the same
canonical placement `cylinder` already has (build canonical at the origin, then
orient/place). `{center:true}` additionally centers Z. `{min, max}` remains for
explicit corners and is unaffected.

Scalar shorthands are permanent, not legacy: `sphere(5)`, `fillet(3)`, and
`chamfer(1)` stay valid and undeprecated — they take a single number with no
transposition risk, so there is no options-form pressure to replace them (only
`fillet`/`chamfer`'s two-argument selector call is superseded, by
`fillet({r, edges})` / `chamfer({d, edges})`).

## Kernel ops (make solids)

Signatures are normative in `kernel.js`'s `@typedef GeometryKernel`; this table fixes
the behavior. Signatures are shown in the canonical options form — the legacy
positional equivalents live in the [Calling convention](#calling-convention) table
above. All ops return a `Solid`.

| Op | Contract |
|---|---|
| `cylinder({r\|d, h, center?})` · `cylinder({r1, r2, h, center?})` \| `{d1, d2, h}` | Cylinder along +Z from z = 0 (straight: exactly one of `r`/`d`); the cone form (`r1`/`r2` or `d1`/`d2` ends) gives a frustum. `center: true` centers on z = 0. |
| `boredCylinder({od, h, bore})` | Compound: cylinder of diameter `od` with a through-bore `bore`. Semantically identical to the composition in `kernel-front.js`; a backend may override only for caching, never for different geometry. |
| `sphere({r\|d})` | Sphere centered at the origin; bare `sphere(r)` stays valid. |
| `roundedCylinder({ r\|d, h, center?, round })` | Cylinder with rim round-overs (`round`: number = both rims, or `{ top?, bottom? }`), built as one lathe `revolve` of an arc-exact profile — real torus faces in STEP. Validation: radii ≥ 0, each ≤ r, top + bottom ≤ h. Options-only. |
| `torus({ rMajor, rMinor })` | Torus centered at the origin, tube centerline in the z = 0 plane; requires 0 < rMinor < rMajor. Curve-exact on B-rep backends. Options-only. |
| `roundedBox({ size, center?, round })` | Box with selectively rounded edges; `round`: number = every edge, or `{ side?, top?, bottom? }` (vertical edges / top rim / bottom rim). Corner semantics and the `0 < side < rim` clamp-with-warning rule are normative in the design spec and summarized under [Rounded primitives](#rounded-primitives). Options-only. |
| `box({size, center?})` · `box({min, max})` | Axis-aligned box: `{size:[x,y,z]}` centered in X/Y with base at z = 0 (`center: true` also centers Z), or explicit `[x,y,z]` `{min, max}` corners. |
| `prism({points, h, twist?, scaleTop?})` | Extrude one CCW contour (point list or arc profile) from z = 0. `twist` = total degrees over the height; `scaleTop` = uniform top scale (1 straight, 0 → apex). |
| `extrude({profile, h, twist?, scaleTop?, bevel?})` | Same, for a polygon-with-holes region — `profile` is `{outer, holes?}` (bare contour = outer only) — in one op, no per-hole boolean. `profile` may also be a `Shape2D` (see below). `bevel` (number = both rims, `{bottom?, top?}` = per rim) cuts a 45° rim bevel; it desugars at the shared front into extrude + loft + intersect/cut, so it is backend-identical by construction and is **not** a CAD-only op (no OCCT routing). Every profile form works — point array, arc profile, `{outer, holes}` (hole rims flare outward), or `Shape2D` (multi-region bevels each and unions) — but curved profiles are **materialized to point rings** first, so a beveled extrusion is faceted at the sampling LOD even in STEP (arc contours at a fixed pure-JS LOD, backend-identical; a `Shape2D` at its backend's own LOD — `hull`'s parity class). No `twist`/`scaleTop`, and `bottom + top < h` or it throws; a bevel a rim's narrow features cannot take is deterministically reduced with a console warning (`ERROR-PATTERNS.md#extrude-bevel-reduced`). |
| `revolve({profile, degrees?})` | Revolve a lathe profile `[[r, z], …]` (r ≥ 0) about Z; `degrees` < 360 gives a capped partial revolve. Default 360. |
| `loft({rings, ruled?, closed?})` | Stack polygon cross-sections (per-ring `z`/`rotate`/`scale`, equal vertex counts) with ruled walls and capped ends. Must self-correct a fully inverted result (CW rings / descending z) to an outward solid. |
| `sweep({profile, path, closed?, cornerRadius?, ruled?, smooth?})` | Sweep a fixed CCW profile along a polyline with a rotation-minimizing frame; sharp mitered corners, or `cornerRadius` fillets; capped ends. |
| `helixSweptTube({pathR, profileR, pitch, turns, z0, lefthand})` | Circle of radius `profileR` swept along a helix (e.g. a rope groove). Circular profile on a frenet frame that rolls with the helix — **not for threads**; use `screwSweep`. |
| `screwSweep({profile, pitch, turns, lefthand})` | Screw-motion sweep of an axial lathe profile `[[r, z], …]` (r ≥ 0) — threads. The profile travels to `(r·cosθ, r·sinθ, z + pitch·θ/2π)`; `h = pitch · turns`. Axial extent must not exceed `pitch` or consecutive turns interpenetrate (throws). A profile spanning exactly `pitch` is **periodic**: first and last radius must agree, and it yields a complete threaded body needing no boolean. Compound: the polar-remapped, densified section extruded with `twist = 360 · turns`, exactly as composed in `kernel-front.js`; a backend may override only for caching, never for different geometry. Options-only. Parity: **within tolerance, not by construction** — both backends receive the identical densified polygon, but the mesh backend facets the twist at its own resolution while the B-rep backend builds an exact spline (`hull`'s parity class). |
| `union(solids[])` | Boolean union of one or more solids. |
| `text2d(string, {size, font?, align?, valign?, lineHeight?, tracking?, kerning?})` | Outline-font text → `Shape2D`. `size` = cap height (mm). `font` = declared name / inline bytes / default. Build-time; curve-exact on OCCT, faceted on Manifold. |
| `hull(inputs[])` | Convex hull of all inputs (each a `Shape2D`, a curve contour, or an `[[x,y],…]` point list) → a convex `Shape2D`. Backend-agnostic: a pure-JS monotone-chain hull over the inputs' sampled points (curved inputs tessellated at a fixed LOD), lifted via `shape2d` (see the parity note below). Throws on an empty input array or a degenerate (collinear/point-count < 3) hull. |
| `hullChain(inputs[])` | Swept hull over an ordered sequence of ≥2 inputs (same input forms as `hull`): the union of `hull([inᵢ, inᵢ₊₁])` for each consecutive pair — e.g. a tapered link connecting a row of circles. Throws with fewer than 2 inputs. |
| `toSTEP(named[])` | `[{name, solid}]` → `Promise<ArrayBuffer>` of a STEP assembly. B-rep class only. |

`hull`/`hullChain` parity: point-list and curve-contour inputs hull bit-identically
across backends (pure-JS sampling, no backend materialization involved). A `Shape2D`
input samples via its own backend materialization (`.toRegions()`), so a hull that
includes a `Shape2D` input agrees only within the tessellation tolerance of that
backend's curve faceting — the same class of parity as the 2-D boolean ops above, not
a waiver of `CONTRACT_VERSION` (still 1; this op is additive).

**Backend-divergent options** (a portable part must treat these as declared here):
`loft` `closed: true` (capless loop) and `sweep` `closed: true` are supported **only by
mesh backends** (Manifold); B-rep kernels throw a plain `Error` naming the limitation
(see the error taxonomy). `loft` `ruled: false` (smooth C2 walls) and `sweep`
`smooth: true` (native swept B-rep) are honored only by B-rep kernels; mesh kernels
render the ruled form. `sweep` `closed: true` loops must be planar. Where both backends build the same
shape they do it **by construction, not by tolerance**: sweep elbows loft the identical
station list (`sweep.js`) on both backends.

### Rounded primitives

`roundedBox` / `roundedCylinder` / `torus` are options-only compound
primitives. `roundedBox` is an atomic compound node; `roundedCylinder`/`torus`
desugar to a `shape2d` + `revolve` pair (both nodes hash deterministically
from the op's arguments). Normative semantics for `roundedBox`
(design spec 2026-07-30): the cross-section at height z is the rounded
rectangle inset by δ(z) with corner radius max(side − δ(z), 0), where δ
traces a quarter circle of the rim radius in each rim zone and is 0 in the
straight zone. Consequences an implementation must honour:

- **side ≥ max(top, bottom)**: top/bottom corners are exact torus patches
  (sphere octants when equal).
- **side = 0**: each rim round-over runs the full edge length and adjacent
  round-overs meet in their natural intersection curve — NOT a
  kernel-specific vertex blend; the top/bottom face keeps sharp corners.
- **0 < side < max(top, bottom)**: the rim radii CLAMP DOWN to side, with a
  console warning (deduped per distinct message). A clamped call and its
  explicitly-clamped equivalent are the same normalized arguments — one
  cache node. For a rim-only round-over use side: 0 exactly.

Validation (op-named plain Errors, backend-identical): radii ≥ 0 and finite;
box: 2·r ≤ min(w, d) for every group, top + bottom ≤ h (strict < when
side > 0 — the two rim fillets would meet tangentially, which the B-rep
backend cannot build; side: 0 full-height round-overs stay valid); cylinder:
rims ≤ r, top + bottom ≤ h; torus: 0 < rMinor < rMajor. `roundedCylinder`/
`torus` are single lathe revolves of arc-exact profiles — B-rep backends
carry real torus/sphere faces to STEP; mesh backends facet at the segs LOD
(the standard exact-vs-faceted split, not a parity waiver). `roundedBox` is
faceted at the segs LOD on mesh backends and exact B-rep on OCCT; measure
parity holds within facet tolerance — except where a rim fillet hits a
degenerate boundary (e.g. rim = side on a stadium profile) and the B-rep
backend skips it with a warning (`ERROR-PATTERNS.md`,
`roundedbox-fillet-skipped`) rather than export invalid geometry.

## Solid ops (combine / transform / query / output)

Normative signatures: `kernel.js`'s `@typedef Solid`.

| Op | Contract |
|---|---|
| `cut(tool)` / `cutAll(tools[])` / `intersect(other)` / `union(other)` | Boolean subtract (single / batched), intersection, and union. |
| `translate(v)` · `rotate(deg, center, axis)` · `mirror("XY"\|"XZ"\|"YZ")` · `scale(factor, center?)` | Transforms — but only two are **rigid** (pose): `translate`/`rotate` move a solid without altering it (position + orientation, shape and handedness preserved). `mirror` **reflects** — it returns the opposite-handed (chiral) solid, which no rotation can reproduce; `scale` **resizes**. So `mirror`/`scale` change the solid *itself*, not just where it sits — think of them as build operations, and never as the difference between a display pose and an export pose (see AUTHORING-PARTS.md `place`). `translate`/`rotate` are the primitives; the placement sugar below is composed *purely from them* (`solid-sugar.js`), so it is geometry-identical on every backend and a host gets it for free via `addSugar()`. |
| `rotateX(deg)` / `rotateY(deg)` / `rotateZ(deg)` · `rotateAbout({axis, deg, through?})` · `along(dir)` · `at(v)` | The readable placement vocabulary parts actually use. `along` maps the canonical +Z build axis to `"±X"\|"±Y"\|"±Z"`. |
| `clone()` | Independent handle (see value semantics). |
| `label(name)` | Name this solid's surface for feature attribution; must survive transforms and booleans; equal names merge into one feature. Affects mesh metadata only, never geometry. |
| `boundingBox()` | `{min, max, center, size}`; `center`/`size` are derived by `addSugar` from the backend's `{min, max}`. |
| `volume()` | Solid volume in mm³. |
| `genus()` / `isEmpty()` | Optional (`SOLID_OPTIONAL_OPS`): mesh-topology queries — through-hole count / no-geometry test. The mesh backend provides them; OCCT has no cheap equivalent. |
| `toMesh({quality?})` | Render mesh: `{positions, normals, indices?, triangles, edges?, featureIds?, features?}`. `indices` optional (a backend may emit soup or indexed); `normals` and `edges` are authoritative shading intent from both backends — see [Shading intent](#shading-intent-tomesh-normals-and-edges) below; `featureIds`/`features` are optional metadata. |
| `toSTL({quality?})` | `Promise<ArrayBuffer>`, binary STL, outward CCW winding. Stored facet normals may be zero — slicers recompute them (the mesh backend happens to write them). |
| `toIndexedMesh({quality?})` | `{positions, indices}` indexed mesh (3MF path); defaults to `"print"` like `toSTL`. Coincident vertices need NOT be welded — the 3MF writer welds, because that format reads topology from the indices rather than re-stitching soup by position the way an STL consumer does. |
| `fillet(r)` · `fillet({r, edges?})` / `chamfer(d)` · `chamfer({d, edges?})` / `shell({t, open})` | B-rep class (core throws `KernelCapabilityError`), *except* a zero magnitude — `fillet(0)` / `chamfer({d: 0})` — which is the identity on every class (returns the solid unchanged, never throws; `shell` excluded, `t: 0` is degenerate). Scalar `fillet(3)`/`chamfer(1)` acts on all edges; the options form adds an `edges` selector. `shell` hollows inward, keeping outer dimensions; `open` (face selector) is required. |

`quality` (`"preview"` | `"print"`) is **advisory**: it trades tessellation density for
speed and a backend may bake it at kernel creation (Manifold does). A part must never
depend on triangle counts, segment counts, or normals being present.

### Shading intent (toMesh normals and edges)

`toMesh` output is the authoritative statement of how a solid SHADES and which
edges are FEATURE edges — consumers (viewer, CLI renderer) must draw what they
are given and must not re-derive either from dihedral angles when the fields
are present:

- `normals` — per-vertex shading normals. Smooth within one surface, hard
  across boolean-cut seams. OCCT ships analytic B-rep normals; Manifold ships
  the policy-aware crease pass (`src/framework/geometry/creased-normals.js`).
- `edges` — flat feature-edge segment pairs (6 floats per segment). An EMPTY
  array means "this solid has no feature edges"; it is not "unknown". OCCT
  ships true B-rep edges with tangent edges (fillet blends, seam lines)
  filtered out; Manifold ships policy-gated sharp/seam segments.

`loft` accepts `shading?: "smooth" | "faceted"` to override facet-vs-smooth
inference: by default, rings with fewer than 32 sides shade as intentional flat
facets with no same-surface edge lines, while rings with 32+ sides (and
`ruled: false` lofts) shade smooth. `shading: "smooth"` forces smooth shading;
`shading: "faceted"` forces facets; any other non-nullish value throws.
Thresholds live in `src/framework/geometry/shading-policy.js`.

Known limitation: the OCCT backend ignores `shading` — a loft forced to OCCT
via `meta.backend` draws its facet corner edges as B-rep feature lines. The
hint is honored on the Manifold path, which is where lofts preview by default.

`label()`ing a compound solid (one spanning more than one original surface)
collapses it to a single shading surface that inherits the majority policy of
its registered constituent surfaces, weighted by triangle count. A constituent
with no registered policy of its own (e.g. a plain boolean tool) still votes,
as SMOOTH — the policy it actually renders with — and an exact tie resolves to
the no-lines (faceted) policy.

**Selectors** (`fillet`/`chamfer` `edges` selector, `shell` `open` face selector) are
declarative objects, criteria AND-combined:

```js
{ dir: "X"|"Y"|"Z",           // edges along / faces normal-to this axis — edge
                              //   selectors ALSO accept an [x,y,z] vector; face
                              //   selectors (shell open) accept ONLY the strings
  inPlane: "XY"|"XZ"|"YZ", at: number,   // in the given plane at offset `at`
  near: [x,y,z] }                        // containing this point
```

`undefined` selects all edges/faces. A raw replicad finder function is also accepted
in-repo (AUTHORING-PARTS.md offers it for parts that are content to stay OCCT-bound),
but it is
inherently backend-specific: portable parts **MUST** use the object form, and a host
**MAY** reject function selectors.

**B-rep repair policy** (`occt-repair.js`): a failing fillet or shell is skipped **as a
whole** — attempted once, and on failure the shape reverts to its pre-op state (OCCT
fillet failures are not monotonic in the radius, so per-edge retry would converge on
garbage). A failing chamfer instead binary-searches the largest valid distance. A
conforming B-rep kernel must degrade this way — a fillet request must never brick the
build, and authors should expect all-or-nothing filleting per call, not per edge.

## Shape2D (2-D booleans)

`k.shape2d(profile)` (`KERNEL_OPS`) lifts a point list, `{outer,
holes?}` region, region array, or arc/curve contour into a `Shape2D` — a 2-D
sketch value carrying booleans, transforms, corner ops and queries. Idempotent:
`shape2d(x)` returns `x` unchanged if `x` is already a `Shape2D`. `_`-prefixed
keys are internals. Normative signatures: `kernel.js`'s `@typedef Shape2D`; the
full public surface is `SHAPE2D_OPS`. The `kernel-front.js`
`KernelCapabilityError` stub for `shape2d` is a dead / future-backend safety net
only (both current backends define the op), not an OCCT limitation.

**Contour storage.** A `Shape2D` stores a **curve-native contour IR** — a region
list `[{outer, holes[]}]` whose contours are `{start, segments}` with line, arc
(`{to, via}`) and cubic (`{to, c1, c2}`) segments. It is *not* a backend handle:
no `CrossSection` and no replicad `Drawing` exists until the shape is handed to a
kernel op. Curves therefore survive every op, on both backends — a rounded corner
is still a circle after a union, and reaches STEP as a real `CIRCLE` entity.

**One shared implementation.** `geometry/shape2d.js` implements the whole surface
against that IR, and both backends instantiate it. Booleans run through **paper.js**
(pure JS, curve-exact), as do the transforms, corner ops and queries — so
`union`/`cut`/`intersect`/`cutAll`, `translate`/`rotate`/`scale`/`mirror`,
`fillet`/`chamfer`/`simplify`, and `area`/`boundingBox`/`corners`/`contains` are
**backend-identical**, not merely parity-tolerant. `area()` and `boundingBox()` are
curve-exact (they integrate the real curves; they do not measure a tessellation).
`offset` runs on this same shared engine (`geometry/contour-offset.js`) — see below —
so it is backend-identical too, like everything else in this list.

**Lazy materialization.** Backend geometry is built only where it is unavoidable.
Three readbacks tessellate to point rings at the backend's own LOD (Manifold 116
preview / 480 print, OCCT 64): `toRegions()`, `simple()` (its unwrapped form), and
`regions()` — scission currently round-trips through `toRegions()`, so each returned
`Shape2D` is a faceted copy, not a curve-native slice of the original. `extrude` and
`revolve` materialize the shape into the backend's own form instead (Manifold: a
`CrossSection`, memoized in the solid cache by content hash + LOD, so extruding the
same shape twice tessellates once; OCCT: a fresh `Drawing` per call, drawn from the
contours — arcs and cubics become true B-rep edges). A `Shape2D` may be passed
directly as the `profile` to `extrude`/`revolve`, holes included. `toContours()` is
the one readback that tessellates nothing.

**Offset runs on the contour IR too.** `Shape2D.offset(delta, { corners })` runs
backend-independently on the contour IR — no backend `CrossSection` or `Drawing` is
ever involved. Lines and arcs offset exactly (arcs stay arcs); cubics are
approximated to ≤ 1e-3 mm deviation. `corners: "round"` inserts exact arc joins,
`"chamfer"` a true 45°-bisecting bevel chord at every corner angle, `"sharp"` miters
with limit 2 (falling back to the bevel chord past the limit). Self-intersecting raw
results are resolved through the shared planar boolean engine (paper.js), which may
return arcs as cubic approximations — identical to boolean-op output. `segs` is
accepted and ignored (there is no backend LOD to tune). Both backends produce
identical offset geometry by construction, like every other Shape2D op.

A region with holes offsets **material-wise**: the outer boundary moves by `delta`,
each hole by `-delta`, so a positive `delta` always adds material (the outer grows,
holes shrink) and a negative one always removes it (the outer shrinks, holes grow) —
never the reverse for either. This one shared implementation is what guarantees it;
a route that offsets a single fused `outer.cut(hole)` drawing with one call gets it
backwards for the holes (see the migration note below).

| Op | Contract |
|---|---|
| `union(other)` / `cut(other)` / `cutAll(others[])` / `intersect(other)` | 2-D boolean ops; `other` may be a `Shape2D` or a raw profile (lifted via `shape2d` first). Curve-exact and backend-identical (paper.js). |
| `offset(delta, {corners?, segs?})` | Grows (`delta>0`) or insets (`delta<0`) by `delta` mm; `corners` = `round` (default) / `chamfer` / `sharp`. Runs backend-independently on the contour IR — lines/arcs offset exactly, cubics approximate to ≤ 1e-3 mm; `chamfer` is a true 45°-bisecting bevel at every corner angle, `sharp` miters with limit 2. Backend-identical by construction, like every other Shape2D op. Holes offset material-wise (`-delta` where the outer gets `delta`). `segs` is accepted and ignored. Empty in → empty out (short-circuits before the engine). Throws if the offset collapses the shape. |
| `area()` | Net area (Σ\|outers\| − Σ\|holes\|), mm². Curve-exact. |
| `boundingBox()` | `{min, max}` — axis-aligned 2-D bounds, curve-exact (no `center`/`size`, unlike `Solid.boundingBox`). |
| `toRegions()` | Materialize into `{outer, holes}[]` point-ring region arrays (`assembleRegions`), tessellating curves at the backend's LOD; a boolean result may be several disjoint regions. |
| `toContours()` | The stored contour IR — `{outer, holes}[]` of `{start, segments}` contours, **curve-native and lossless** (no tessellation). Returns a deep copy, safe to mutate. |
| `simple()` | `toRegions()` unwrapped — throws unless the result is exactly one region. |
| `regions()` | Scission: each disjoint region as its own live `Shape2D[]` (each further boolean-able), vs `toRegions()` which returns raw `{outer, holes}` data. Goes through `toRegions()`, so the pieces are tessellated at the backend's LOD — curves do not survive scission. |
| `translate([dx,dy])` / `rotate(deg, center?)` / `scale(f\|[sx,sy], center?)` / `mirror(axis)` | Rigid/similarity transforms on the contours (curve-preserving). `center` defaults to the origin; `axis` is `"x"`, `"y"`, or `{point, dir}`. `scale`'s factor is uniform when a bare number, per-axis when `[sx,sy]`. |
| `fillet(r, {corners?})` / `chamfer(d, {corners?})` | Round (true arcs) or bevel (straight chords) selected corners. `corners` = `"all"` (default) / `"convex"` / `"concave"` / `{indices}` / `{near, count?}`; `r`/`d` may be an array paired positionally with `{indices}`. Throws when no corner matches. |
| `simplify(tolerance)` | Corner-preserving decimation/refit within `tolerance` mm — dense point rings become fewer segments (and refit arcs/cubics) without moving corners. |
| `corners()` | The corner list — `{index, point, interiorAngleDeg, convex, segTypes}[]`. This positional order is what `fillet`/`chamfer`'s `{indices}` selects into. |
| `contains([x,y])` | Point-in-shape test (inside an outer, not inside a hole). |
| `isEmpty()` | `true` when the shape has no regions at all — a `cut`/`intersect` legitimately removed everything. Pure JS on the stored IR, backend-identical. See "Empty shapes" below. |
| `extrude({h, twist?, scaleTop?})` | Sugar for `k.extrude({profile: this, …})` → `Solid`. Throws on an empty shape (see "Empty shapes"). |
| `revolve({degrees?})` | Sugar for `k.revolve({profile: this, …})` → `Solid`. Throws on an empty shape (see "Empty shapes"). |
| `clone()` | Independent copy. Every op returns a NEW `Shape2D`; no operand is ever mutated. |

**Empty shapes.** An empty `Shape2D` is a legal 2-D value, and every 2-D op is total
on it: booleans treat it as the identity/absorbing element, transforms and `offset`
return it unchanged, `area()` is 0, `toRegions()` is `[]`. What it cannot do is become
3-D: `extrude` and `revolve` (either calling form, on both backends) throw
`"<op>: the profile Shape2D is empty — nothing to build (a cut/intersect may have
removed everything; guard with .isEmpty())"`. The check runs in the shared op-spec
layer before any backend materialization, so the two backends agree by construction.
A part whose parameters can drive a feature to nothing guards explicitly:
`if (!pocket.isEmpty()) body = body.cut(pocket.extrude({ h }))`. (Before this was
pinned, Manifold silently built an empty solid where OCCT threw — behavior no part
could rely on portably, so defining it follows the reference backend and is not a
contract break.)

On `offset`: `round`, `sharp`, and `chamfer` all agree across both backends **at every corner angle, convex or reflex** — a 10×10 square offset +1 gives 142.0 on both, a pentagon 298.920 on both, and an equilateral triangle's chamfer agrees to float precision on both, with no acute-corner carve-out. This follows from `offset` being one native implementation rather than a call into either backend's own 2-D engine — there is no Clipper2-vs-OCCT split left to diverge.

The three tessellating readbacks — `toRegions()`, `simple()`, `regions()` — remain LOD-dependent: they hand back point rings sampled at the backend's own segment count, so the two backends' output differs in vertex count and by chord error, converging as LOD rises. Those three ops are the whole LOD-dependent surface; everything else, including `offset`, is backend-identical.

**Known limitations.** The native offset engine has verified defects on specific input
shapes — on inward offsets that sever a shape, and on outward offsets of text — under **all
three corner styles at nearly the same rate**; see [Offset: known
limitations](#offset-known-limitations) below for the parked cases, their measured values,
the committed corpus and script that produce every rate quoted there, and the independent
construction the truths come from.

**Fillet after a boolean reaches STEP as real arcs.** Because booleans preserve curves
and `fillet` inserts true arc segments, `shape2d(a).union(b).fillet(2).extrude({h})`
exports a filleted profile as `CIRCLE` B-rep entities on OCCT — the corner op does not
have to run before the boolean, and no facet fan is baked in along the way. (Manifold
facets at mesh LOD, as always, since its meshes have no curve representation.)

### Offset: known limitations

The native offset engine preserves line, arc, and cubic contour IR through its normal cleanup
path. Tangled raw offsets are split at crossings, classified under the Positive winding rule,
and chained back into regions by `geometry/contour-winding.js`. Positive round dilation also
uses the source hole's inradius to prove when a counter has fully closed, and positive
dilation drops output components that contain no source material. These are source-domain
topology proofs, not output-area heuristics.

The reported text case is covered as correctness in
`test/offset-oracle-manifold.test.js`: the 6-glyph × 7-delta round matrix, including
`"Scott"` at +0.8/+1.5/+2/+3, matches Clipper2 region and hole counts exactly and stays
within the corpus area tolerance. `"Scott"` retains native arcs and cubics at every tested
delta.

**Measured failure surface.** The committed instrument is
`node scripts/offset-rates.mjs`, over 600 deterministic seeded shapes plus six glyph cases,
20 deltas, and three corner styles (36,090 attempts). In partforge 0.60 it reports:

- before the retry ladder: round 1/12,030 (0.008%), chamfer 2/12,030 (0.017%), sharp
  4/12,030 (0.033%);
- after the retry ladder: zero chain-incomplete failures for all three styles;
- seven oracle-checked rescues, with median area error 0.0972%, worst 1.663%
  (2.2373 mm²), zero region-count losses, and zero complete arc losses.

The ladder remains a numerical escape hatch: it perturbs delta by 1e-9, coarsens crossing
clustering, then tries polyline outlines. A future case that reaches a coarse clustering or
polyline rung can still lose fine topology or native arcs, so the order remains
fidelity-first and every newly found rescue must be checked against the independent
Minkowski oracle.

The currently parked limitations are narrower:

- **Round erosion with several holes reaching the eroded outer can keep too much material.**
  The characterized 30×20 plate with three rectangular holes at −2 returns about 324.75
  instead of the 258.18 oracle truth under round corners; chamfer and sharp are exact.
- **Fully eroded holes under sharp and chamfer can leave a remnant.** The source-inradius
  gate is intentionally limited to round joins, whose structuring element is a Euclidean
  disk. A 1×1 hole at +2 closes correctly under round, while the sharp/chamfer variants
  remain parked rather than applying the wrong geometric criterion.
- **Erosion can emit sub-0.001 mm² rings.** Five exact seeded cases are pinned in
  `test/offset-fuzz.test.js`. They are not automatically deleted: unlike positive
  dilation, erosion has no source-membership invariant that distinguishes a false island
  from a genuine surviving crumb.

The fuzz oracle sweep covers 150 seeded shapes × 6 deltas × 3 styles and currently reports
no region-count, hole-count, or area disagreements outside those explicit
characterizations. Do not widen tolerances or add an area-based sliver filter when a new
case appears; add its deterministic fixture and establish the source-domain truth first.
## The 2-D helper library

`partforge/geometry` ships pure-JS helpers of several kinds. The **contour builders**
(`piePolygon`, `hexPolygon`, `regularPolygon`, `roundedRectPolygon`, `ellipsePolygon`,
`slotPolygon`, `starPolygon`, `ringSectorPolygon`, `circleProfile`, `cornerArc`,
`filletPolygon`, `roundedProfile`) are pure functions from numbers to plain CCW point
lists or arc profiles — *data already in this contract's input format*, with no kernel
dependency at all. The **solid patterns** (`linearPattern`, `circularPattern`) take a
`Solid` and call only ops from the tables above (`clone`/`translate`/`rotate`/
`boundingBox`). The **profile transform** (`offsetPolygon`) takes a point list or
`{outer, holes}` region and grows or shrinks it by a delta in mm — printer-clearance
offsetting with round/chamfer/sharp corner styles — validating its input and result and
throwing rather than ever returning degenerate (self-intersecting or collapsed)
geometry. All are therefore portable by construction: a host implements the kernel and
the helpers come along unmodified. (`test/kernel-contract.test.js` asserts every
`polygon.js` export is named here.)

- `pathProfile` — fluent builder for a curve-native path contour (`lineTo` /
  `arcTo` / `cubicTo` / `close`); cubic segments become exact B-rep on OCCT and
  facet at mesh LOD on Manifold.

### 2-D editing ops

The **2-D editing ops** are the free-function twins of the `Shape2D` transforms,
corner ops and queries documented above — the same `contour-ops.js`/paper.js
machinery, callable directly on a point list, a `{start, segments}` contour, a
`{outer, holes}` region, or a region array, with no `shape2d()` lift required.
Every op returns the same shape of input it was given (a bare point list stays a
point list, upgrading to a contour only if the op introduces curves — e.g. a
non-uniform scale on an arc). The arc-length queries are the one exception:
being single-contour by nature, they throw on a region. The full set: `translateProfile`,
`rotateProfile`, `scaleProfile`, `mirrorProfile`, `filletProfile`, `chamferProfile`,
`profileCorners`, `profileLength`, `profilePointAt`, `profileTangentAt`,
`profileNearestPoint`, `profileBounds`, `profileArea`, `profileContains`,
`simplifyProfile`, `validateProfile`.

| Group | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Transforms | `translateProfile(input, [dx,dy])` | exact on all segment types |
| | `rotateProfile(input, deg, center?)` | arcs stay arcs |
| | `scaleProfile(input, s \| [sx,sy], center?)` | non-uniform scale converts `{to,via}` arcs to cubics |
| | `mirrorProfile(input, axis)` | `axis: "x" \| "y" \| {point, dir}` |
| Corners | `filletProfile(input, r, opts?)` | `r` may be an array paired with `{indices}` |
| | `chamferProfile(input, dist, opts?)` | symmetric setback, straight connector |
| | `profileCorners(input)` | `[{index, point, interiorAngleDeg, convex, segTypes}]` |
| Queries | `profileLength(contour)` | mm; single contour only |
| | `profilePointAt(contour, {t} \| {length})` | single contour only |
| | `profileTangentAt(contour, {t} \| {length})` | unit vector; single contour only |
| | `profileNearestPoint(input, [x,y])` | `{point, distance, contourIndex, segmentIndex, t}`; accepts regions |
| | `profileBounds(input)` | curve-exact `{min, max}` |
| | `profileArea(input)` | outers − holes, curve-exact |
| | `profileContains(input, [x,y])` | curve-aware containment |
| Cleanup | `simplifyProfile(input, tolerance)` | corner-preserving decimation/refit |
| Validation | `validateProfile(input)` | `{ok, issues}`; never throws |

`filletProfile`/`chamferProfile`'s `opts.corners` selector and `profileCorners`'s
positional order match `Shape2D.fillet`/`Shape2D.chamfer`/`Shape2D.corners`
exactly — `CornerSelector` above applies unchanged. Mirror and negative-scale
inputs re-normalize winding (outer CCW, holes CW) before returning, so no op can
hand the kernel inverted regions.

## Worker rebind

The op tables above are the portable seam for *geometry*; this section is the matching
seam for *worker lifetime*. A host that shows one part after another (an embedder, the
cloud runner) can keep a single worker across the swap and reuse its booted WASM kernel
and warm solid cache instead of paying the boot cost again.

`runWorker(part)` (`src/framework/worker.js`) returns a rebind handle —
`{ setPart(newPart) }` — and that handle is the whole interface. The framework defines
**no rebind *message***: a host that talks to its worker over its own re-init protocol
maps that protocol onto `setPart` itself.

`setPart(newPart)` does four things, synchronously, on the worker's own turn:

- **Swaps the part** for jobs that arrive *after* the call. Jobs already queued keep the
  part that was current when their message arrived — a job always runs against the part
  it was sent for, never against a part that replaced it mid-flight.
- **Bumps the generate epoch**, which is what makes earlier builds stale (below).
- **Sweeps each booted kernel's solid cache** — one `sweepCache()` per booted kernel,
  never inside a `beginSubPart`/`endSubPart` bracket. See the Optional ops paragraph
  under [Conformance classes](#conformance-classes) for what the sweep evicts; a host
  whose kernel omits the op simply keeps every partition.
- **Re-posts `{type:"ready"}`**, so a remounting host gates its first generate on
  readiness exactly as it would on a freshly spawned worker.

**Epoch guard.** Generates supersede each other; exports (`export-stl`/`export-step`/
`export-3mf`), `inspect`, and `lint` are **never** epoch-guarded — cancelling a user's
export because an edit landed would be wrong. A generate that is stale by the time the
job pump reaches it is skipped and never builds at all. A generate already running
re-checks staleness at each sub-part boundary and, if it has been superseded, stops
there and posts `{type:"superseded"}` **instead of** `{type:"meshes"}` — a build that
ended without producing meshes, and not an error. A generate with no boundary left to
stop at — one that goes stale during its *final* sub-part, or a single-sub-part generate
that goes stale once the pump has dequeued it — runs to completion, and the worker then
discards its result the same way, posting `{type:"superseded"}` in place of the meshes it
built. So **a `meshes` post is current as of the moment it is posted**: it is never a
previous part's geometry surfacing after a rebind, and a host may take it as the build
outcome for the part it currently has mounted.

**Host-side rule for `superseded`.** partforge's own `mount()` does not handle a
`superseded` message, and does not need to: in its single-mount flow the regen loop
serializes generates, so no generate is ever in flight when the next one is sent and the
message is unreachable. An **embedding host that rebinds via `setPart` must** do one of
two things:

- detach the old message listener before rebinding — the partforge-cloud pattern. A
  rebound worker's next mount sends its first generate *after* `setPart`, so that
  generate can never be stale, and any `superseded` from the previous mount lands on a
  listener that is already gone; or
- handle `superseded` explicitly as "this build ended without meshes" — clear the busy
  state, keep the current geometry, and wait for the next result. A host that instead
  lets it fall through a `meshes`-only handler leaves a spinner up forever.

**Only `meshes` is epoch-gated**, so the second option is the weaker one. A stale build's
other posts — `progress`, `error`, `needs-occt` — are not gated and still reach a listener
that survived the rebind: a stale `error` would mark a perfectly good new part failed, and
a stale `needs-occt` would stickily flip the host's backend for a part that never asked for
it. Handling `superseded` fixes the stuck spinner but not that crosstalk, which is why
detaching the listener is the recommended pattern.

**Cancellation granularity is the sub-part.** The guard is checked only between
sub-parts (one macrotask yield each), so a single long WASM op — a big boolean, an OCCT
fillet — runs to completion no matter how stale it is. That is by design: WASM kernel
calls are not interruptible, and a build that abandons a sub-part mid-bracket would
strand pinned cache entries. Hosts should size responsiveness expectations against the
slowest single sub-part, not the whole build. Cancellation is therefore about *work
avoided*, never about correctness of what is posted: work already under way may finish,
but its output is still gated behind the epoch before it leaves the worker.

## Versioning

The contract version is the number at the top of this document, mirrored by
`CONTRACT_VERSION` in `kernel.js` (the parity test asserts the two match). The op lists
in `kernel.js` define the current surface; only breaking changes bump the version:

- **Additive** (new kernel/Solid op, new optional field on an options object, new
  optional mesh-output field): contract version unchanged, minor npm release. Old parts
  run everywhere; new parts need hosts that implement the new op.
- **Breaking** (changed signature or semantics, removed op, new *required* argument,
  tightened validation that rejects previously valid input): contract version bump,
  **major npm release**, and a migration note added here. Removal without a major bump
  is forbidden.
- The naming vocabulary is frozen deliberately: where a name was arbitrary it matches
  the OpenSCAD/Manifold/CadQuery consensus (`union`, `translate`, `rotate`, `mirror`;
  `cut` per CadQuery/replicad rather than OpenSCAD's `difference`), so LLM priors
  transfer. Renames are breaking changes with no offsetting benefit — don't.

**v1 → v2** (partforge 0.59): `Shape2D.offset` moved off the two per-backend 2-D
engines (Clipper2 via `CrossSection` on Manifold, replicad's `Drawing.offset` on
OCCT) onto the single native contour-offset engine described above. Semantics
changed, not just implementation: `offset` is now backend-identical by construction
at every corner angle (the old acute-corner `chamfer` divergence and the LOD-faceted
Manifold result are both gone), and `segs` is now accepted-but-ignored rather than
tuning Manifold's tessellation. Holes offset material-wise (`-delta` where the outer
gets `delta`) on both backends — the deleted OCCT production route got this backwards
by fusing `outer.cut(hole)` into one `Drawing` and offsetting it with a single call,
so holes grew under a positive `delta` instead of shrinking; no test caught it because
there was no holed-offset test before this contract version. Parts that relied on the
old holed-offset direction (if any existed) need the sign of their workaround removed.

**`sharp` and `chamfer` change shape on acute corners — check these when migrating.** This
is a real geometric change, not a precision polish, and it is the one thing v1 parts should
be re-measured for. Once a convex corner gets tighter than 90° the two old backends did not
agree with each other, and neither agreed with this repo's own `offsetPolygon`; v1's claim
that "`round` and `sharp` are exact across backends at every angle" was simply false.
Measured on an 11-point star (alternating radii 10 and 4) at `delta` +2:

| corners | native (v2) | Clipper2 (v1 Manifold) | OCCT (v1 B-rep) | `offsetPolygon` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `round` | 295.933 | 295.933 | 295.933 | 295.933 |
| `sharp` | 282.158 | 300.671 | 326.534 | 282.158 |
| `chamfer` | 278.389 | 288.138 | 278.389 | 278.389 |

The spread is **miter-limit policy**, not accuracy: OCCT miters unbounded, so an acute spike
shoots arbitrarily far past the corner; Clipper2 squares the corner off past its own limit
rather than bevelling it. Native applies miter limit 2 and falls back to a plain bevel — the
same rule `offsetPolygon` (`geometry/polygon.js`) has always used, so `offset` and
`offsetPolygon` now agree to the digit where previously *neither* backend matched the pure-JS
helper sitting next to it. `chamfer` additionally lands exactly on OCCT's `bevel` join; only
Clipper2 differed there, because it had no bevel join and approximated one with two chords.

Practical rule: divergence from v1 is confined to `sharp` and `chamfer` on **outward**
offsets of shapes with sub-90° convex corners (star points, V-notches, triangles, spiky text
serifs), and native is always the *smaller*, never the over-solid, result — a clearance
offset that fit in v1 still fits. `round` is unchanged at every angle, inward offsets are
unchanged, and shapes whose corners are all ≥90° (rectangles, hexagons, rounded-rects, slots)
are unchanged. A random-polygon sweep put the >1%-divergent share at 1.6% overall, every one
of them `sharp` or `chamfer` at positive delta.

## Why not an existing CAD language

Considered and rejected as the part format (2026-07; revisit if the landscape shifts):

- **CadQuery** — largest corpus after OpenSCAD, but its workplane-stack + string-selector
  model is B-rep-native and cannot be implemented on the mesh backend; Python besides.
- **KCL (Zoo)** — designed for LLM generation, but young, sketch-plane-shaped, and tied
  to one vendor's engine; adopting it costs the dual-backend seam.
- **replicad** — already the OCCT backend; part of partforge's value is papering over
  its consuming-transform semantics. Matching downward would re-expose them.
- **OpenSCAD** — closest semantic cousin (Manifold is its modern engine) and the largest
  LLM prior; unadoptable as syntax (own language, no fillets/STEP), so we align
  *vocabulary* instead.

The recurring constraint: every op here is implementable on **both** a mesh-CSG kernel
and a B-rep kernel (see `docs/geometry-backend-strategy.md` for why that dual-backend
property is worth protecting — OCCT booleans are ~75–1400× slower). Generation *safety*
comes not from a restricted DSL but from the verify loop (`measure`/`verify` gates:
`bbox`, `volume`, `holes`, `watertight`, overlaps — plus `minWall` *warnings*, which
report but never fail) — a generator gets machine-checkable
pass/fail feedback per part, which a syntax could never provide.

## Conformance checklist for a new backend or host

1. Implement `KERNEL_OPS` + `SOLID_OPS` (stub `OCCT_ONLY_OPS`/`toSTEP` with
   `KernelCapabilityError` if core class); route through `finishKernel()`/`addSugar()`
   if building in-repo to inherit validation, sugar, and stubs.
2. Pass `test/kernel-contract.test.js` (op-list parity) — add an equivalent for an
   out-of-repo host.
3. Honor the global semantics above (units, Z-up, CCW, value semantics, determinism).
4. Run **every part in `src/parts/`** through `npx partforge measure` unmodified — the
   directory, not this prose, is the acceptance suite (today that includes
   `faceted-vase.js`, the `loft` exerciser, and — B-rep class — `filleted-box.js`).
   Caveat: a part with no `verify` block (`filleted-box.js` today) exercises only the
   default measure gates, so B-rep implementers should also render it and export STEP
   rather than trust the exit code alone.
