# Error patterns — symptom-indexed lookup

When a build, test, `measure`, or `verify` run fails confusingly: **grep this file
for the symptom first** — the literal error text, or a phrase describing the
misbehavior — before debugging from scratch.

**How to add a pattern** (`##` headings are reserved for pattern entries — the lint
test parses every one; keep prose like this as plain paragraphs):

- One pattern per `## <id>` heading. The heading is a **stable kebab-case ID**:
  permanent once committed — never renamed, never reused. External consumers
  (issue #27 diagnostics, HARDWARE.md, skills) cite `ERROR-PATTERNS.md#<id>`.
- **Namespaces:** core framework patterns are bare slugs. Subsystem patterns take
  a reserved prefix — `hardware-*` is reserved for the parts library (issue #30).
  One `#`-level section per namespace.
- Entry shape — exactly these three list lines, then optional note paragraphs:
  - **Symptom:** the literal string an agent would see, verbatim in backticks,
    when one exists; otherwise the observable misbehavior. This is the grep target.
  - **Cause:** one sentence.
  - **Fix:** the concrete change, linking the governing rule
    ([AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) section) rather than restating it.
- No tables inside entries.
- Code that throws should throw greppable strings: an error message thrown by
  partforge should appear verbatim, in a backtick literal **at the start** of its
  pattern's Symptom line. Only that leading literal is what the crash matcher
  matches on — backticks used for prose later in the line never participate, so a
  reworded Symptom must lead with the thrown string, not bury it mid-sentence.
- `test/error-patterns.test.js` lints this file's structure.

# Core framework

## worker-imports-main-entry

- **Symptom:** `ReferenceError: document is not defined` thrown from a worker build.
- **Cause:** The part (or a helper it imports) imports `partforge` instead of `partforge/geometry`, and the main entry pulls in the DOM viewer/controls.
- **Fix:** Import geometry helpers only from `partforge/geometry` in anything a worker loads. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Geometry: the kernel / `Solid` API".

## impure-build-stale-preview

- **Symptom:** Preview geometry doesn't change after editing the part's `build` (or changes once, then sticks), with no error anywhere.
- **Cause:** The preview kernel memoizes geometry by content hash, and an impure `build` (`Math.random`, clock, module-level mutable state) silently defeats it.
- **Fix:** Make `build` a pure function of `(k, p, d)`; move randomness/state into `derive` inputs or delete it. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Caching & determinism".

## replicad-consumed-operand

- **Symptom:** On the OCCT backend a solid is unexpectedly empty, or the build crashes, right after the same solid was transformed or used in a boolean — often only in STEP export, with the Manifold preview fine.
- **Cause:** replicad transforms and booleans (`translate`/`rotate`/`mirror`/`cut`/…) consume their operand — the input solid is deleted and a new one returned.
- **Fix:** Never reuse a solid after transforming it; take a `.clone()` first when you need the original again. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Geometry: the kernel / `Solid` API" (the `s.clone()` row).

The framework itself rebuilds each sub-part fresh per job and applies `place` once, which avoids the problem — follow the same pattern in your own code.

## probe-routed-to-occt

- **Symptom:** A part builds far slower than expected (preview takes seconds instead of milliseconds), and the worker logs show it running on the `occt` worker.
- **Cause:** The geometry-free probe runs `build` against a recording proxy (dummy query values), and a `fillet`/`chamfer`/`shell` call it reaches — including a branch the real build wouldn't take, since queries return dummies — routes the whole part to OCCT.
- **Fix:** Remove the CAD-only call the probe reaches unnecessarily, or force the backend with `meta.backend: "manifold"` (or `"occt"`). See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Fillet & chamfer (automatic OCCT backend)".

## boolean-not-watertight

- **Symptom:** `NOT watertight ✗` from `partforge measure` (non-zero exit) after adding a boolean cut or union.
- **Cause:** A coplanar-face or grazing-cut degeneracy — the tool surface exactly touches the body surface, leaving zero-thickness geometry.
- **Fix:** Overcut: extend the tool past the faces it pierces (e.g. the demo's cut tool is `h + 4` starting at `z = -2`) and avoid exactly-flush faces in unions. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Verifying a part headlessly (render + measure)".

## dual-kernel-same-process

- **Symptom:** A test file crashes or hangs (WASM abort) when it boots both geometry kernels.
- **Cause:** OCCT and Manifold WASM must not boot in the same process.
- **Fix:** Keep OCCT-booting tests in their own files (vitest isolates per file) and boot via `bootOcctKernel()` in a `beforeAll`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Testing a part".

## view-dependent-display-place

- **Symptom:** A sub-part renders correctly in one view but appears misplaced (usually in its other-view pose) after switching views.
- **Cause:** A `place` that depends on `ctx.view` for `purpose: "display"` — display meshes are built once per sub-part and cached across views.
- **Fix:** Make display placement view-independent; only `place(..., { purpose: "export" })` may branch on `view`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "The `PartDefinition` contract".

## place-not-rigid

- **Symptom:** The exported/printed part is a mirror image of — or a different size than — the same part shown in the assembly/display view. Nothing throws: the preview looks right and only the STL/STEP is wrong, or vice-versa.
- **Cause:** A `place` whose `purpose: "display"` and `"export"` branches differ by a non-rigid transform — `mirror` (flips handedness) or a non-identity `scale` (changes size) — so display and export are no longer the same solid, only its reflection/resize.
- **Fix:** Keep the display-vs-export `place` difference a rigid motion (`translate`/`rotate`/`rotateAbout`/`along`/`at`) only. If the part genuinely needs a reflected or resized form, bake that into `build` so both purposes share one canonical solid and pose it rigidly. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "The `PartDefinition` contract".

## wrong-node-version

- **Symptom:** Confusing failures during `npm install`, tests, or CLI runs — WASM load errors, syntax errors in dependencies, or kernels that never boot — on a machine that built fine before.
- **Cause:** The shell's default Node is older than the required Node 24 (`.nvmrc` pins it).
- **Fix:** Run `nvm use` before `npm install`, tests, or any `npx partforge` command. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Quickstart".

## worker-url-not-inline

- **Symptom:** The app loads but geometry never builds — the worker 404s or is missing from the production bundle (works in `npm run dev`, breaks in `npm run build`).
- **Cause:** The `new Worker(new URL(...))` call was moved out of the app entry file (into a helper or variable), so Vite's static analysis can't see and bundle the worker.
- **Fix:** Keep `new Worker(new URL("./<part>-worker.js", import.meta.url), ...)` inline in `src/app-<part>.js`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Wiring a part into a runnable app".

## minwall-sliver-triangles

- **Symptom:** `⚠` minWall warnings from `verify` on a faceted part whose walls are clearly thicker than the profile minimum.
- **Cause:** The ray-shot wall-thickness measurement can catch sliver triangles at facet seams, reading a near-zero "wall" that isn't a designed wall.
- **Fix:** Check where the reported thin spot is: at a facet seam or chamfer transition it's a sliver artifact (minWall is a warning, never a gate — safe to note and move on); along a real wall, thicken the wall. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Self-verification (the `verify` block)".

## near-miss-gap

- **Symptom:** A `⚠ … nearMiss` warning or `✗ … contact` failure from `verify` reporting sub-parts `N mm apart, expected touching`, or a `near-misses:` line in `measure` output for parts that look joined in the preview.
- **Cause:** Two sub-parts that should meet don't quite — a boss shorter than the gap it must bridge, a mis-placed mating datum in `derive()`, or a union that silently missed. Renders and volume/bbox checks cannot see sub-mm joint gaps; this check exists precisely for them.
- **Fix:** If the pair should touch, grow the joining feature or fix the datum math so the faces meet, then declare the pair in `verify.expect._view.contacts`; if a free fit is intended, declare it under `clearance`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Self-verification (the `verify` block)".

## expect-static-across-presets

- **Symptom:** A `verify` exact gate (`holes`, `volume`, …) fails on SOME presets only — e.g. `✗ planter holes 1  (0 != 1)` on two cases while defaults pass — and the preview looks right for every preset.
- **Cause:** `verify` runs `expect` across defaults + every preset, and a preset legitimately changes the asserted fact (an optional feature like a drain/bore toggles the genus), while the expectation is one static value.
- **Fix:** Declare `expect` as a pure function of the case's resolved params — `expect: (p, d) => ({ body: { holes: p.drain > 0 ? 1 : 0 } })` — or restrict `verify.cases`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Self-verification (the `verify` block)".

## param-key-missing-from-defaults

- **Symptom:** The affected control's number box renders empty/blank (internally `numStr(undefined)` produces the string `NaN`, which a number input sanitizes to empty), or its range slider sits at a browser-default position and edits don't drive the geometry — no error is thrown — and if the key is `hidden`, no control is rendered for it at all.
- **Cause:** A `key` used in the `parameters` schema (slider, feature, or preset override) doesn't exist in `defaults` — every key must, including `hidden` ones.
- **Fix:** Add the key to `defaults` with a sensible starting value. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Parameters: the control-panel schema".

## dimmed-control-vestigial-param

- **Symptom:** A control renders dimmed (but still editable) and changing it does nothing on screen.
- **Cause:** No sub-part visible in the active view reads that parameter — the relevance-aware panel dims controls with no on-screen effect.
- **Fix:** This is a signal, not a bug: either the parameter is vestigial (delete it), the control is in the wrong section/view scope, or you're in a view that legitimately doesn't use it. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "The relevance-aware panel".

## linked-checkout-wasm-403

- **Symptom:** In a consuming app using an `npm link`ed partforge checkout, the kernel never boots and the dev-server network tab shows `403` on the Manifold/OCCT `.wasm` files.
- **Cause:** The linked checkout lives outside the app's project root, so Vite's dev server refuses to serve its files.
- **Fix:** Allow-list it: `server: { fs: { allow: ["./", "../partforge"] } }` in the app's `vite.config.js`. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Developing against a local (linked) partforge".

## ring-sector-full-circle

- **Symptom:** `ringSectorPolygon: arcDeg must be < 360 (use a cut for a full ring)`
- **Cause:** A full annulus can't be a single simple polygon — it's a contour-with-hole.
- **Fix:** Cut an inner cylinder from an outer one (or `k.extrude({ profile: { outer, holes }, h })`); use `ringSectorPolygon` only for partial arcs. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Profiles & patterns".

## occt-closed-loop-unsupported

- **Symptom:** `loft: closed:true loops are only supported on the Manifold backend` (or the same message from `sweep:`) — typically during STEP export of a part that previews fine.
- **Cause:** Capless closed loops are a Manifold-only capability; the OCCT backend rejects them, and STEP export always runs on OCCT.
- **Fix:** Keep the part on Manifold (no STEP) or model the loop as a capped solid both backends support. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Geometry: the kernel / `Solid` API".

## smooth-geometry-faceted-preview

- **Symptom:** A `ruled:false` loft or `smooth:true` sweep looks faceted/straight-walled in the viewer even though the options are set.
- **Cause:** Smooth blending is OCCT-native; the Manifold preview always tessellates ruled straight walls — only STEP export carries the smooth surface.
- **Fix:** Nothing is wrong — verify smoothness in the exported STEP, not the preview. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Geometry: the kernel / `Solid` API".

## scale-moved-the-part

- **Symptom:** After `s.scale(f)` a part is resized but also relocated — features drift away from where they were built.
- **Cause:** `scale(factor, center?)` defaults its center to the origin, so scaling an off-origin solid about the origin also translates it.
- **Fix:** Pass the center you mean, e.g. `s.scale(f, s.boundingBox().center)` to resize in place. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Geometry: the kernel / `Solid` API".

## occt-holes-watertight-na

- **Symptom:** `watertight n/a` in `partforge measure` output, and `holes`/`watertight` assertions in a `verify` block don't run, on a part with fillets/chamfers.
- **Cause:** `holes` and `watertight` are Manifold-only topology facts, and this part auto-routed to OCCT — the assertions skip rather than fail.
- **Fix:** Expected behavior: assert on backend-independent facts (`bbox`, `volume`, `overlaps`) for OCCT parts, or split topology assertions into a Manifold-buildable configuration. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Self-verification (the `verify` block)".

## html-page-missing-in-prod

- **Symptom:** A part's page 404s in the production deploy while working fine under `npm run dev`.
- **Cause:** Only pages listed in `build.rollupOptions.input` are compiled by the production build; other root `*.html` pages are dev-only conveniences Vite serves without building.
- **Fix:** Add the page to `build.rollupOptions.input` in `vite.config.js` if it should ship. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Wiring a part into a runnable app".

## options-unknown-key

- **Symptom:** `unknown option` — e.g. `cylinder: unknown option "radius" — did you mean r?`
- **Cause:** an options-form kernel call passed a key the op does not accept (typo, or long-form vocabulary like `radius`/`height`).
- **Fix:** use the canonical keys from the op table in [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md); the error's did-you-mean / valid-keys hint names them.

## options-missing-key

- **Symptom:** `is required` — e.g. `cylinder: h is required`, `sweep: path is required`.
- **Cause:** an options-form kernel call omitted a required key.
- **Fix:** supply the key; canonical forms are in the [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) op table and KERNEL-CONTRACT.md "Calling convention".

## cylinder-radius-keys

- **Symptom:** `cylinder: pass exactly one of r/d, or r1+r2 / d1+d2`
- **Cause:** mixed or missing radius vocabulary — both `r` and `d`, straight + cone keys together, only one cone end, or `r1`+`d2`.
- **Fix:** straight cylinders take one of `r`|`d` plus `h`; cones take `r1`+`r2` or `d1`+`d2` plus `h`.

The sphere variant is `sphere: pass exactly one of r/d` (same cause and fix).

## box-size-vs-corners

- **Symptom:** `box: pass size or min+max, not both`
- **Cause:** the two `box` forms were mixed in one call.
- **Fix:** either `{size, center?}` (centered in X/Y, base at z=0; `center:true` centers Z too) or `{min, max}` — see [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md).

## box-center-with-corners

- **Symptom:** `box: center only applies to the size form`
- **Cause:** `center` was passed alongside `min`/`max`, but explicit corners already fix the placement.
- **Fix:** drop `center`, or switch to `{size, center?}` — see [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md).

## offset-polygon-bad-input

- **Symptom:** `offsetPolygon: need at least 3 points`
- **Cause:** malformed input to `offsetPolygon` — too few points after dedup, or (variant messages) a non-finite `delta`, non-finite coordinates, an unknown `corners` style, or a profile that is neither a point list nor `{outer, holes}`.
- **Fix:** pass a CCW `[[x,y],…]` list (≥ 3 distinct points) or `{outer, holes}`, a finite `delta` in mm, and `corners: "round" | "chamfer" | "sharp"` — see [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "Profiles & patterns".

Variant literals under this entry: `offsetPolygon: delta must be a finite number`, `offsetPolygon: coordinates must be finite numbers`, `offsetPolygon: corners must be "round" | "chamfer" | "sharp"`, `offsetPolygon: profile must be a point list or {outer, holes}`.

## offset-polygon-input-self-intersects

- **Symptom:** `offsetPolygon: input polygon self-intersects`
- **Cause:** the input contour crosses itself — the profile is broken before any offsetting happens (checked up front so bad input is not blamed on the offset).
- **Fix:** repair the generating math for the contour; the offset envelope requires simple polygons in and out.

## offset-polygon-collapse

- **Symptom:** `offsetPolygon: offset collapses the polygon`
- **Cause:** the offset consumed the shape — either an inset ate the whole polygon (result area ≤ 0 or fewer than 3 points, `|delta|` past the narrowest half-width; also thrown for a region hole that would vanish), or an offset displaced an edge past its own length so the edge inverts (a large inset, or a large *outset* of a concave profile where `|delta|` exceeds a reflex-adjacent edge — this last case can also depend on `corners`, since `"sharp"` extends edges further than `"round"`/`"chamfer"`).
- **Fix:** reduce `|delta|`, or clamp it from the shape's dimensions before offsetting (see planter.js's wall cap). If a vanishing hole is intended, remove the hole from the region explicitly. Realistic clearances (fractions of a mm) on any profile, and wall insets up to the narrowest feature, never trip this.

## offset-polygon-result-self-intersects

- **Symptom:** `offsetPolygon: offset result self-intersects (reduce |delta| or simplify the profile)`
- **Cause:** the true offset of this shape at this `|delta|` is not a single simple polygon (e.g. insetting a dumbbell past its waist would split it in two) — out of `offsetPolygon`'s envelope.
- **Fix:** reduce `|delta|`, or decompose the profile into separately-offset simple contours.

## cubic-segment-mixes-arc-and-cubic

- **Symptom:** `extrude: <role> segment cannot mix arc (via) and cubic (c1/c2)`
- **Cause:** A path-contour segment carries both `via` (three-point arc) and `c1`/`c2` (cubic Bézier). A segment is exactly one kind.
- **Fix:** Drop `via` for a cubic, or drop `c1`/`c2` for an arc. Use `pathProfile().arcTo(to, via)` or `.cubicTo(to, c1, c2)` to build segments.

## cubic-segment-missing-controls

- **Symptom:** `extrude: <role> cubic segment needs c1 and c2 as finite [x,y]`
- **Cause:** A cubic segment is missing `c1` or `c2`, or a control point is not a finite `[x,y]` (e.g. `NaN`, wrong length).
- **Fix:** Provide both control points as finite `[x,y]`. A cubic Bézier needs two controls between the previous point and `to`.

## shape2d-simple-not-single-region

- **Symptom:** `Shape2D.simple: result has N regions, not 1 (use toRegions())`
- **Cause:** `.simple()` was called on a boolean result that is empty or split into multiple disjoint regions (e.g. `intersect` of disjoint shapes, or a `cut` that severs a shape in two).
- **Fix:** Use `.toRegions()` to get the array, or adjust the operands so the result is a single connected region. See [AUTHORING-PARTS.md](AUTHORING-PARTS.md) § "2-D booleans".
