// This package ships PLAIN ESM SOURCE and prose — the published files are the
// artifact, and every tool a reader reaches for treats them as text. A single
// stray control character breaks that quietly and completely: git marks the file
// binary and prints "Binary files … differ" instead of a diff (so the file is
// invisible in every review, local and on GitHub), `grep` skips it, and `file`
// reports `data`.
//
// That is not hypothetical. src/framework/lint/rules-vector.js shipped two raw
// NUL bytes as a dedup-key separator, and the whole module went unreviewed on its
// branch because no diff ever rendered it. Nothing in the suite noticed, because
// the RUNTIME behaviour was fine. So assert the property that actually matters:
// what we publish is text.
//
// Scope comes from package.json's `files` — the definition of "shipped" — rather
// than a hand-kept list here, so a new published path is covered the day it is
// added. That covers docs/ and README.md too, which are as much of the product as
// src/: AUTHORING-PARTS.md and VECTOR-FORMAT.md are what an authoring agent reads.
