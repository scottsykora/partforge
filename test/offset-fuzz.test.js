// Seeded fuzz for the 2-D offset engine: random shapes from the committed corpus
// (test/helpers/offset-corpus.js), offset at several deltas under all three corner styles,
// compared against the independent Minkowski-union oracle on REGION COUNT, HOLE COUNT and
// area — in that order of importance.
//
// Why topology first: the text bug this branch exists to fix sat within 0.1–0.3 % on area
// while being badly wrong topologically (a dilated "o" whose counter had closed came back as
// 25 regions and 11 holes, 0.21 % from the true area). An area-only oracle passes that. So
// this file asserts counts, and treats area as the weaker of the two checks.
//
// Determinism: the corpus is a pure function of integer seeds (mulberry32, never
// `Math.random`), so every failure below names a seed that reproduces it forever, both here
// and from `node scripts/offset-rates.mjs --seed <n>`.
//
// Boots manifold-3d (for the oracle's polygon-set assembly only — the oracle never calls
// anybody's offsetter). Must not share a process with OCCT; vitest isolates per file.
