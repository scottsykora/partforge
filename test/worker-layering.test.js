// The geometry Web Worker's import closure is a layering boundary, and until now it
// was held only by discipline. Nothing statically reachable from src/framework/worker.js
// may touch the DOM, three.js, or Node — the worker has no `document`, no `window`, and
// no `node:fs`. A contributor who imports tooltip.js into jobs.js for one convenient
// helper passes every other test in this suite and only explodes at worker runtime with
// "document is not defined", inside a WASM-booting worker, with no stack worth reading.
// So walk the graph and assert it.
//
// This is also what keeps the src/framework/oracle/ vs src/testing/ split honest: the
// oracle (measure/verify/build/BVH) runs inside this worker for the `inspect` job, while
// src/testing/ boots kernels from disk and writes PNGs. If someone moves a Node-only
// helper back under the oracle, the `node:` check below names the chain.
