// Oracle: the deleted Manifold/Clipper2 offset route, reconstructed test-locally
// against the raw manifold-3d WASM (not the framework's manifold-backend.js, which
// no longer has an offset route at all — Shape2D.offset runs the native engine on
// BOTH backends now). This is the safety net for the native contour-offset engine:
// it exists to FIND divergence from Clipper2, not to be green.
//
// Compares round + sharp + chamfer. Chamfer maps to Clipper2's Round join with
// circularSegments=4 (NOT this file's SEGS=64) — the exact mapping the deleted
// manifold-backend.js used for chamfer, since a true 45-degree bevel is a 4-segment
// "round" arc collapsed to its chord. That mapping matches native to float precision
// at interior angles >= 90 degrees (the deleted backend's own comment: "the two agree
// to float precision for convex corners with interior angle >= 90deg"); at ACUTE
// (<90deg) corners Clipper2's 2-facet approximation genuinely diverges from native's
// true bevel (see KERNEL-CONTRACT / manifold-backend history) — but no corpus case
// below has an acute corner (square/L-shape/circle are all >=90deg), so that
// divergence is real but currently UNEXERCISED. A future acute-cornered corpus
// addition must account for this before enabling chamfer on it.
//
// Manifold must NOT boot in the same process as OCCT (see offset-oracle-occt.test.js) —

// Task 7B emptied this list; Task 7C's Minkowski-union oracle (test/helpers/minkowski-oracle.js)
// refilled it. Fixing the vertex-incident self-crossing miss made the engine agree with that
// oracle on every case the fix touched, but sweeping ~13 800 rectilinear cases against the
// oracle surfaced three classes it does NOT touch, all pre-existing. They are parked here per
// this file's convention: the truth is DERIVED in-file (never hardcoded), the engine's current
// defective value is pinned in a loose band, and the root cause is recorded. A fix is expected
// to break these tests, at which point the case moves up into the corpus.
//
// The oracle used here is the Minkowski construction, not `clipperArea` — Task 7B established
// that Clipper2's Round@circularSegments=4 is not this engine's chamfer at acute corners, so
// for newly-found divergences the construction that never calls an offsetter is the arbiter.
//
// Task 7D updated this list: class 3 (the four-notch comb) is no longer a throw and has moved
// up into the corpus below the parked block; what is parked in its place is the narrow residual
// band the fallback ladder still does not cover. It also retired the "the remaining gap is the
// ROUND join — arcs reaching resolveOffsetWinding" reading that stood here. Round is where MOST
// of the remaining defect sits, but not all of it (class 2 is join-independent, and chain
// failures were measured under chamfer and sharp too, on rectilinear shapes whose offsets
// contain no arcs at all), so the arc mechanism is disproven and no replacement mechanism is
// asserted. What the classes below share is only that chamfer and sharp are exact on the same
// inputs, which is evidence of a real engine defect rather than oracle error — not a cause.
