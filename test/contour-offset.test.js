// combinations (uppercase/lowercase/digit counters on 10mm Roboto text at delta 0.1–0.5mm),
// every failure a total hole loss with no warning. Root cause: the round-1 tolerance bounded
// discretization error with a sagitta model valid only for sampleArc's angle-capped stepping,
// not for sampleBezier, and it ignored OFFSET_TOL (the cubic-offset approximation's own error
// budget) entirely — on the r=5 cubic-circle case the deficit against the flattened source was
// 2.404e-2 against a tolerance of 2.372e-2, a 1.3% margin, so curved-hole survival was close
// to a coin flip. Attempted the prescribed fix (exact line/arc distance via closed-form
// point-to-circle math, adaptive cubic flattening to OFFSET_TOL/10, tolerance derived from
// OFFSET_TOL rather than chord length) — it fixed the circle, the rounded-rect, and the "P"

// isn't really about tolerance sizing: the wide-L-pocket's own raw hole (Part 2's one
// justification) is already `dirty` from Part 1 before Part 2's check ever runs, and so are
// the failing glyph counters — there is no scoping condition available on a raw, pre-cleanup
// ring that reliably tells "prune this, it's really gone" apart from "leave it, cleanup will
// recover it." Per the standing instruction that silently deleting real geometry is strictly
// worse than the single defect (the wide-L-pocket) the prune existed to fix, Part 2 is REMOVED
// entirely as of this round rather than shipped delicately tuned — see the wide-L-pocket
// test above (a real, passing test since task 7 — it was a test.todo when this note was
// written) and task-5B-report.md's round-2 section for the full derivation and the
// 76-combo sweep. These three are kept as permanent regression coverage against reintroducing
