// partforge/oracle — the geometric oracle as its own published entry.
//
// This is the SEAM between the oracle and everything that consumes it. The same
// modules serve three callers: the geometry worker lazy-loads them per job family
// (see jobs.js — an `inspect` pulls measure/verify/build, and the generate/export
// hot path pulls none), the CLI and Node harnesses import them here directly, and
// partforge/testing re-exports this whole surface so an existing downstream import
// keeps working. Everything below is DOM-free, three-free and node:-free —
// test/oracle-entry.test.js walks the closure and holds that, so the entry stays
// importable from a worker, a browser, or Node alike.
//
// The SEMANTIC MESH ORACLE (imported mesh -> feature report) is NOT here, and this
// framework has no verb, job or import for it: it is its own closed package, which
// peer-depends on this one and consumes exactly this entry — the mesh/BVH helpers
// and file parsers below are exported for it. A host that installs it registers its
// job through the generic `runWorker(part, { jobs })` seam (jobs.js).
