// Reference part for k.screwSweep — an ISO-style metric bolt. The thread uses the
// PERIODIC profile form (spans exactly one pitch, first radius == last radius), so
// one screwSweep call yields the whole threaded shank with no boolean against a
// core. See docs/AUTHORING-PARTS.md "Helical & threaded features".
