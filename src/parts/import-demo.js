// Reference part for docs/AUTHORING-PARTS.md's "Importing geometry" section —
// the worked example for BOTH import uses in one part:
//   • reference — `ref` is a translucent ghost of the imported scan (never
//     exported); `body` is a parametric rebuild of the same block, bound to
//     the scan via `reference: "scan"` and held to it by the three ref*
//     deviation metrics in `verify.expect.body`.
//   • component — `mount` uses the import as a real boolean tool: a plate
//     with a through-socket cut to the scan's own shape (scaled up by `fit`
//     for clearance), exported like any other sub-part.
// `src/parts/assets/import-demo-scan.stl` is a small hand-written ascii STL —
// a 20×14×8 mm block, origin-cornered, outward-wound. `body`'s defaults
// reproduce those dimensions exactly, so the deviation gate passes with real
// margin. Open /import-demo.html after `npm run dev`.
