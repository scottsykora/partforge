// as one of these — without this repo naming it, importing it, or knowing its message
// shapes. Built-ins win a name clash (a host cannot redefine `generate`); a type with
// no handler at all is ignored, as unknown types always were. A handler's throw is
// posted as the ordinary `{type: "error"}` any failed job posts.

// Each result branch declares its own transferables (the big binary buffers,
// zero-copy across the worker boundary) right where the buffers are created —
// so a new job type can't silently regress to structured-cloning its payload.

      // inspect with no `view` (partforge-cloud's requestReport has always sent

      // downstream consumer degraded silently: measure reported zero subparts and a
      // [0,0,0] bbox, match scored nothing, and verify still passed. Pre-0.55,
      // measure built internally and its own signature default hid this. Found by a
      // live browser check, not by tests: this suite passes explicit views, and the
      // cloud's unit tests fake the worker.

      // `checks: "quick"` is the agent's fast lap. Min wall and pair distances are
      // the oracle's two ray-casting passes and, profiled on a 460k-triangle
      // assembly, 79% of its cost — and they SHARE the BVH those rays need, so
      // skipping one leaves the index build standing and saves about half of what
      // skipping both does. Everything else is derived from the build this job
      // already paid for and stays: triangles, bbox, volume, genus, watertight,
      // and the assembly overlap check. verify still runs — the gates that read

      // passing it, which is why `quick` can be honoured on a gated part instead
