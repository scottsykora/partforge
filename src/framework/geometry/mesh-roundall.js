// Morphological whole-solid rounding on the mesh backend: close-then-open with
// a ball — dilate(+r), erode(2r), dilate(+r) via Manifold's native Minkowski
// sum/difference. Rounds EVERY edge (convex and concave) at radius ≈ r and
// consumes features smaller than the ball (walls < 2r melt, holes < 2r seal) —
// that is the op's contract, not a defect (docs/roundall-design.md).
//
// simplify() between steps is mandatory, not an optimization: the naive
// Minkowski (hull-of-triangle-pairs) emits sliver-degenerate meshes whose
// complexity compounds through the chain — the design spike measured 106s and
// 761k broken-topology triangles without it vs 2.4s and 340 clean triangles
// with it, on the same torture case. asOriginal() first, because simplify()
// will not collapse triangles across run (originalID) boundaries and the
// Minkowski output is stitched from many.
//
// This op must NEVER throw KernelCapabilityError / NEEDS_OCCT: the mesh
// backend is roundAll's reference implementation — rerouting to OCCT would
// trade a correct result for a skip (occt-roundall.js can only skip where
// morphology exceeds what B-rep offsets support).
//
// INVARIANT — both balls share ONE segment count. Minkowski support functions
// add, so the chain displaces a face with normal n by 2·h_r(n) − h_2r(n), where
// h is the ball's support. Manifold spheres built with equal `segs` are similar
// (the 2r ball is the r ball scaled by two), so h_2r = 2·h_r and the term is
// exactly zero in EVERY direction — the input's planar faces return to their
// original planes. Give the two balls different segment counts and the term is
// only zero where a vertex happens to line up: axis-aligned boxes still look
// right while off-axis faces drift (measured 0.07mm at preview, r=2). The count
// is sized from the erosion ball (2r), the larger of the two, so the coarser of
// the two facetings still meets the tier's sagitta tolerance.

// Sphere tessellation from the facet sagitta r·(1 − cos(π/segs)): pick the
// fewest segments that keep it under the quality tier's tolerance.

// equal section × height (a bulge parked between the slice planes would pass the
// slice checks alone). Any failure returns null and the caller keeps the
// reference morphology — the fast path may only ever substitute, never widen.
