// Circular-arc recovery: runs of cubic segments that lie on a common circle
// become symbolic {to, via} arcs.
//
// paper.js has no arc primitive, so importSVG returns every curve as a cubic —
// a <circle> arrives as four of them. Without this pass the OCCT backend would
// build a spline where the artwork had a circle. Recovering at the CONTOUR level
// rather than special-casing <circle> means arcs from `A` commands, rounded-rect
// corners, and transformed circles all come back through one mechanism.
//
// The fit is exact, not approximate. Paper's kappa construction pins each
// cubic's ENDPOINTS to the true circle and only the interior deviates, so a
// three-point fit through endpoints recovers the original centre and radius to
// float precision. The tolerances are therefore an acceptance test on the
// interiors, not the accuracy of the result — see runFits for why there are two
// of them and why a radius-relative one alone is not enough.
//
// Pure leaf: DOM-free, node-free.

// Does every probed interior point of every cubic in `run` lie on the circle?
//
// TWO bounds, and the tighter one wins. `ARC_TOL * r` alone is not a usable
// acceptance test, because r is the FITTED radius: the flatter a curve is, the
// bigger the circle it fits, so the band grows without limit exactly where the
// author's own feature is smallest. A gentle asymmetric cubic — the single most
// common thing in real logo artwork — fitted a circle of r = 913 and was accepted
// with a maximum deviation of 0.70 against its own sagitta of 1.43. Half the
// curve's depth, silently, and the stored file then claimed `"kind": "arc"`, so
// nothing downstream could recover the intent.
//
// The second bound is relative to the cubic's own CHORD — the straight distance
// between its endpoints. Chord is the right base rather than sagitta because it
// stays finite and meaningful as the curve flattens (sagitta goes to zero, which
// would reject genuine shallow arcs) and never degenerates on a closed run (the
// whole run's chord does: a full circle's endpoints coincide). It is a scale the
// artwork actually has, and it does not move when the fit does.
//
// CHORD_TOL is set with real headroom over what genuine circles need. Paper's
// kappa construction pins each cubic's endpoints to the true circle and errs only
// in the interior, by about 2.7e-4 * r for a 90° cubic and far less for shallower
// ones. Measured against this module's own fit, over sweeps of 1°-90° and radii
// from 0.5 to 1e5, the worst genuine deviation is 1.83e-4 of chord — so 2e-3
// leaves an 11x margin. The two shallow non-circular cubics that used to be
// accepted deviate by 3.1e-3 and 6.8e-3 of chord, comfortably outside it.
