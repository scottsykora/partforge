// flattened cubic distance instead of a chord-length-bounded tolerance, to stop losing curved
// holes to discretization noise). Round 2 confirmed the prune's own justification was sound —
// the wide-arm-L-pocket case it exists to fix is a genuine defect (max inscribed circle in a
// 5-wide-arm L has radius 2.5 < delta 3, so the hole DOES fully vanish; a truth value is
// derivable and the pre-fix engine got it wrong) — but even with exact-geometry distances, a
// sweep of real glyph counters (uppercase/lowercase/digit counters on 10mm text at delta
// 0.1–0.5mm) still lost 36 of 76 entirely, all silent total-hole-loss, none
// recoverable by further tolerance tuning: the wide-L-pocket's own raw hole ring is ALREADY
// `dirty` from Part 1 before any distance check runs, and so are the failing glyph counters —
// there is no scoping condition (dirty vs not, tolerance size, source curve type) that
// distinguishes "prune this, it's really gone" from "don't prune this, cleanup will recover
// it" using only the raw, pre-cleanup ring. The prune's collateral (silently deleting real
// text counters at sub-millimetre offsets) is strictly worse than the single defect it fixes,
// so it's gone rather than shipped delicately tuned. See task-5B-report.md's round-2 section
// for the full sweep. (The wide-L-pocket case itself is no longer an open gap: task 7's
// resolveOffsetWinding — see below — resolves it correctly with no per-ring heuristic at all,

// The fallback ladder for a raw offset whose arrangement the winding resolver cannot close
// (contour-winding.js's CHAIN_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE). Each rung re-runs the SAME offset with one
// numerical nuisance perturbed, and the first rung that produces a non-empty region set wins.
//
// Why a ladder exists at all: the chain failure is a defect in resolving a degenerate
// arrangement, not a statement about the shape — the material is really there. Left as a
// throw it reads, in a parametric app that re-offsets on every slider move, as "the part
// builds at 2.4 mm and dies at 2.5 mm", which is a harder failure than any other defect class
// in this engine (all of which degrade to bounded inaccuracy).
//
// RATES, and where they come from. Run `node scripts/offset-rates.mjs` — it sweeps the
// committed corpus (test/helpers/offset-corpus.js: 600 seeded shapes + 6 glyphs, 20 deltas,
// 3 styles = 36 090 offsets, ~25 s) and prints these. Before the ladder / after it:
//   round 0.183 % -> 0.000 %   chamfer 0.183 % -> 0.000 %   sharp 0.200 % -> 0.008 %
// (One residual across all 36 090: seed 323 multi-region at −4 under sharp only; the other
// two styles build it.) Rescue quality across the 67 rescues, oracle-checked: median area
// error 0.025 %, worst 2.87 %, and ZERO rescues with fewer regions than the truth — the
// probe-era ladder's region-welding cost class is gone with the rung that caused it.
//
// Rung ORDER is by cost-to-fail first, then fidelity of what survives; every rung earns its
// place by rescues no other rung covers (winning-rung counts from the same sweep):
//   1. probe-labels (26 wins) — the pristine arrangement, exact IR and crossings, but
//      corroborated midpoint probes override face labels on long pieces. This is the rescue
//      for the one class face labels get systematically wrong: an exact inter-ring tangency
//      mis-orders the rotational order at the contact at EVERY weld scale, so no re-welding
//      escapes it, while a mid-piece probe never looks at the contact. Everything survives:
//      corner style, arcs, positions — and it FAILS fast (a BFS label conflict throws before
//      any probing), which is why it runs before the full re-runs below.
//   2. delta ±1e-9 relative — full pipeline re-runs. Zero wins on the seeded corpus (its
//      continuous coordinates never produce exact degeneracy) but the FULL-FIDELITY escape
//      for grid-coordinate input whose offset walls land on the same coordinate exactly —
//      the four-notch comb at −2.4975 in test/offset-oracle-manifold.test.js is float-exact
//      through this rung and 0.018 mm² off through any later one.
//   3. polyline@64 (6 wins) — the raw outline re-run as chords. Geometrically faithful to
//      that tessellation's sagitta but it DEGRADES THE IR: round joins come back as chords,
//      so a STEP export of the result loses its true circles (measured on the probe-era
//      corpus: a 10 mm "Scott" at +1 came back 0 arcs / 6 435 line segments). Documented in
//      KERNEL-CONTRACT.md § Offset.
//   4. snap@1e-3 (35 wins) then snap@5e-3 (last resort) — the raw outline quantized to a
//      grid before resolving. See snapRing: a nearly- or fully-collapsed ring's raw offset
//      is a hairball of near-parallel strands below combinatorial resolution that no
//      crossing set describes at ANY merge radius; quantized, near-coincidence becomes
//      exact coincidence, which the resolver's multiplicity handling is built for. This is
//      the collapse-regime rung — the input class the reported text bug lives in. Same IR
//      cost as the polyline rung, plus positions move by up to grid/2.
//
// Rungs the probe-era ladder carried that are gone, by measurement, not taste: the
// clusterTol ×4/×20 re-welds won ZERO of the 67 rescues under face-labeled classification
// (their caseload was probe misclassification, which no longer exists) and owned the
// one-region-fewer defect class; polyline@256/1024 covered nothing polyline@64 or the snap
// rungs miss while dominating the ladder's latency (~1.9 s per collapse-regime "Scott"
// slider tick with them, ~0.15–0.35 s without). The rejected-rung reasoning from the probe
// era still holds where it wasn't rung-specific: never retry under a different JOIN
// (unbounded error, and visibly different corners than the caller asked for), and never
// perturb delta beyond noise scale.
//
// The ladder as named, LAZY rungs — one list, walked by chainFallback below and by
// scripts/offset-rates.mjs, so a measurement of "what each rung costs" can never drift from
// the ladder that actually ships. Every rung's whole body (including tessellating the outline
// for the polyline rung) runs inside its own thunk, so a rung that throws in its own SETUP
// moves to the next rung like any other rung failure rather than escaping chainFallback with
