//   creaseAngle       deg — same-surface edges bending more than this shade hard
//   sameSurfaceLines  whether same-surface edges past creaseAngle also draw lines
// Cross-surface (boolean cut seam) behavior is not policy: seams always shade
// hard, and draw a line when bent more than COPLANAR_ANGLE.

// rule for it: a seam between a blend and a NON-blend surface draws regardless of
// bend — the band's start/end are tangent (~0°) and would otherwise be invisible,
// leaving the fillet's extent unreadable in the overlay. A seam between TWO blend
// surfaces keeps the ordinary bend rule (exactly-one-side semantics), so the
// handover seams along one band — tool splits, corner arcs continuing a sweep —
// stay invisible while real mitre crossings still draw.
