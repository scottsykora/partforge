// The pure part model: which sub-parts a view shows, which of those are exportable,
// how a part's params resolve, and how one posed sub-part solid is built. No async,
// no worker protocol, no kernel boot — just synchronous functions over a
// PartDefinition, a kernel handle, and params.
//
// Deliberately a LEAF of the framework graph. buildPosed is the single definition of
// "a posed sub-part solid", so the worker job loop (jobs.js), the collision check
// (assembly.js), the relevance probe (param-deps.js), and the headless oracle
// (oracle/) all call it. Keeping those four functions out of jobs.js — which is
// async, imports the kernels, and pulls in the whole export stack — is what lets the
// oracle depend on the part model without an import cycle back through the job loop.
