// partforge/lint — static PartDefinition validation. Pure: no I/O, no async, and

// guarantee is enforced by test/lint-purity.test.js — read it before adding an import.
//
// A rule is { id, run(ctx) → Finding[] }, one rule object per finding id, so the
// registry doubles as the documented rule catalog. Rules are cheap and parts are
// tiny; clarity beats sharing a walk between rules.
