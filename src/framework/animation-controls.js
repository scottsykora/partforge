// decision is measured against, as opposed to the measured union above, which is
// what the bar is actually PLACED against. Two rects, two purposes.
//
// Deciding "is the bar crowded?" from the measured union oscillates, because the
// cube is part of that union and hiding it is the consequence of the answer:
// cube visible → wide union → bar capped → crowded → hide the cube → its rect
// is all zeros → unionRect drops it → the bar fits → not crowded → show the cube
// → round again. Two frames per cycle, each one a ResizeObserver notification,
// on screen as a flickering cube. This rect does not depend on whether the stack
// is displayed, so the answer is a fixed point: hiding the cube cannot change
// it.
//
// The stack's edges are derived from the viewbar's because chrome.css anchors
// both to the same margin: `.pf-float-viewbar` is `bottom: 12px; right: 12px`
// and `.pf-viewcube-stack` is `right: 12px` with its bottom resting on top of
// the viewbar (`--pf-viewbar-clear` + a few px). So the stack shares the
// viewbar's right edge, reaches a published width in from it, and occupies the
// band directly above the viewbar's top. That small gap between them is
// deliberately NOT subtracted: a hair taller than the truth is the safe
// direction for a "would these two collide?" test — and this rect is therefore
// unaffected the day chrome.css retunes it (2026-08-20 took it from 8px to 3).
//
// Null/empty-tolerant on exactly unionRect's terms — a zero-area rect is the
// ABSENCE of a claim, not a claim on the stage's top-left corner:
// - no viewbar rect (a host that drops #viewbar) → nothing to anchor a nominal
//   stack on, so fall back to the cube's own measured rect; if that is empty
//   too there is nothing to decide against at all. This one fallback is
//   visibility-DEPENDENT and so not a fixed point — it is the best available
//   answer without the viewbar anchor, and it only applies to a host that has
//   removed the viewbar entirely.

  // --- placement: keep clear of the bottom-right cluster ---------------------
  // chrome.css centers the bar (left: 50% / translateX(-50%)), and nothing in
  // CSS can stop that centered position sliding under the bottom-right cluster
  // when the stage narrows — #viewbar's width is dynamic (cutaway's Flip/Reset
  // appear and disappear), so a static reservation would either overlap or
  // waste centre space. Measure instead: when the transport bar's vertical
  // band intersects the CLUSTER's — #viewbar unioned with the view cube stack
  // sitting above it, since that stack can be taller than the viewbar alone —
  // clamp the bar's left so a 10px gap holds, capping its width if even the
  // stage's 12px margin isn't enough. Overrides are inline and cleared at the
  // top of every pass, so chrome.css (or a host that re-anchors any of these
  // elements out of the shared band) stays authoritative the moment the
  // constraint stops binding. The clear-measure-apply sequence is loop-safe: it
  // settles within one frame, so ResizeObserver — which reports rendered sizes
  // at frame boundaries — never sees the intermediate state.
  //
  // A pass also decides whether the bar is CROWDED — out of room to the point
  // of capping its own width, which shrinks its controls below the 44px tap
  // target — and reports that through onCrowded so the cube can give way. That
  // decision is measured against the NOMINAL cluster rect, never the union used
  // for placement: see nominalClusterRect for why the difference is the whole
  // design. It is reported LAST in the pass, after the bar has been placed, so
  // the hide it may cause lands on the next frame's pass rather than
  // invalidating the rects this one just measured.
