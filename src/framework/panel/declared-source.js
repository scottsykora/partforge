// The problem this solves is not cosmetic. A part's bundled default lives in the
// `images`/`vectors` DECLARATION, never in `defaults` — an author cannot move it
// there, because the allow list passes only `https` and a bundled asset resolves
// to a `file:`/dev URL, so `defaults: { relief: new URL(…) }` is refused and
// reset. The declaration is therefore the only home for it, and the panel could
// not see the declaration at all: `buildControls` receives `part.parameters`.
// The result was a control that opened empty while the part was plainly building
// from an image.
//
// Main-thread only, and deliberately import-free beyond what a lookup needs: it
// runs during panel construction, on every rebuild.

// author code running on every panel build), and a broken declaration must not
// take the panel down: the control simply shows nothing, which is the same thing
// it showed before this existed.
