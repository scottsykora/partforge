// The auto-regenerate state machine (no DOM, no workers — pure orchestration).
// mount.js wires it to the geometry service: `missingParts` reports what the
// active view still needs, `send` dispatches one build job for those parts.
//
// Invariants (pinned by test/framework/regen-loop.test.js):
// - nothing is sent until ready() (the worker announced its kernel);
// - at most one dispatch CYCLE is in flight; kicks while generating are absorbed
//   and the caller re-kicks after the cycle's last buildDone(). `send` may fan a
//   dispatch out to several workers (per-sub-part backend routing) and reports
//   how many jobs it posted; each worker reply is one buildDone();
// - markDirty() bumps the params version and debounces a kick, so dragging a
//   slider queues one build per pause, not one per pixel;
// - a build that a mid-flight edit outdated is reported stale by buildDone()
//   (return false → the caller discards the meshes and kicks a rebuild);
// - markDirty({debounce:false}) bumps without arming the timer (the animation
//   fast-apply path kicks explicitly).
