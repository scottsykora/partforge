// Framing math for the showcase capture (viewer.js captureCurrentFromScene):
// where the visible geometry lands in the rendered frame, and the centred
// sub-window that puts it in the middle. Pure three.js math, no GL — the
// renderer builds its camera through makeCaptureCamera too, so what this
// module projects through is exactly what renderOffscreen draws with.
//
// Why vertices and not bounding boxes: the projection of a triangle mesh is a
// union of projected triangles, and a triangle's projected extremes are its
// corners — so the min/max over projected VERTICES is the exact 2-D extent of
// the rendered silhouette at any angle, where a projected 3-D bounding box
// over-reports by up to the box's slack at diagonal views.
//
// Why a view offset and not a pixel crop: three's setViewOffset renders a
// sub-window of a larger virtual frame with the same projection, so the
// recentred image is a pixel-exact crop of what the user framed — at the full
// requested resolution and with no second JPEG encode.

// matrixWorldInverse without a render having happened first.
//
// `near`/`far` default to the historical fixed pair, which is what a caller
