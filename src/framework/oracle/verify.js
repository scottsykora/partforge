  //   is read off the artifact, so a caller cannot assert it wrongly.
  //
  // THE MIN-WALL SUPERSET RULE, which is the trap here. measureCase asks for
  // `{ minWall: needMinWall }`, and needMinWall is false whenever no profile and
  // no expectation mentions min wall. A result measured WITH min wall is a strict
  // superset of one measured without: the extra fields are only ever read by the
  // minWall metric, which by definition this run never checks. Reuse in that
  // direction is free. The reverse is NOT safe — a seed taken without min wall
  // carries `minWall: null` on every sub-part, which the registry reports as
  // "min wall unavailable", silently downgrading a real gate to a warning. So the
  // seed is consulted only when `seed.result.measuredMinWall || !needMinWall` —
  // and `measuredMinWall` is stamped by measure() itself, not claimed by whoever
  // holds the result. Otherwise the seed is ignored and the case measured properly.
  //
  // ALIASING. A consulted seed is memoized BY REFERENCE, so the caller's result
  // and every case that hits it are the same object — the inspect job's
  // `report.measure` and `report.verify.cases[0]`'s facts included. Nothing here
  // mutates facts (evaluateCase only reads), and that is what makes the sharing
  // safe; a future check that wants to annotate a fact must copy first.
  //
  // Keyed through the SAME signature() the memo uses, never a JSON compare of the
  // raw params — a separate compare would miss cases that share a signature (a
  // preset touching only params the build never reads) and, worse, could hit on
  // params that merely look equal. The seed's params are layered over
  // part.defaults first because a caller's `{}` and the defaults case's
  // `{...part.defaults}` build identical geometry but hash differently
  // (JSON.stringify({}) is not JSON.stringify(defaults), and relevanceHash reads
  // params[k] straight through). The view is checked too: measure()'s output is
  // per-view, and a seed from another view would be a silent wrong answer.
  //
  // Non-default measure options (a custom `gapThreshold`) are the caller's
  // responsibility: seed only a measurement taken the way verify would take it.
  // Under `quick` the superset rule is not waived so much as satisfied differently:
  // a min-wall-less seed is reused, and the min-wall gate it cannot answer becomes
  // `unevaluated` instead of being re-measured. The rule exists to stop a coarse
