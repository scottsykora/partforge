// src/framework/oracle/min-wall.js
// Min wall thickness by ray/shot on a triangle BVH (see the spec's spike: this beat the
// voxel/SDF approach on both accuracy and speed). For each surface triangle, cast a ray
// inward (reverse of its outward normal) from the centroid; the nearest hit is the local
// material thickness. The minimum across samples is the reported min wall.
// Works with both Manifold non-indexed meshes and OCCT indexed meshes (via the BVH's
// flat vertex store — never materialize a triangle-per-object list here, that is the
// allocation this pass exists to avoid).
//
// SAMPLING CONTRACT. One ray per triangle is unbounded work, and a dense mesh makes it
// the dominant cost of the inspect job: ~1.9 s and hundreds of megabytes of transient
// garbage at 400k triangles on a laptop, several times that on a phone. Past
// MAX_SAMPLES triangles the pass casts from a spread subset instead, and SAYS SO —
// the result always carries { sampled, sampledTriangles, totalTriangles }, so a
// report consumer can tell a guaranteed minimum from a lower-confidence one. A
// sampled reading is an upper bound on the true minimum: it can miss a thin spot,
// never invent one. `sampledTriangles` is the SAMPLE BUDGET — how many triangles
// the walk selected — not a count of rays actually cast: a degenerate (zero-area)
// triangle has no normal to cast along and is skipped without a ray.
//
// Only an EMPTY mesh reads as no result at all (`null`). A mesh whose sampled rays
// all miss returns the usual object with `value: null`, because the sampling
// accounting is exactly what a reader needs in that case — "we looked at 50k of
// 400k triangles and found no wall" is a very different statement from "nobody
// measured", and the two used to be indistinguishable downstream.

// preview-quality mesh of a fairly ornate part lands in the low tens of thousands.
// 50,000 is comfortably above both while capping the pass at roughly a quarter

// are the only ones that engage it. Override per call with `{ maxSamples }`.

// max gap on a 480-triangle mesh sampled 100 times: 8). A contiguous slice would
// read one region of the surface, and a plain n/budget stride can beat against a
