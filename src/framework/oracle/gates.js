// Which declared gates a part actually has — the questions the oracle asks before
// deciding how hard to work. Kept out of verify.js so measure() can ask the same
// question without importing verify (which imports measure), and so there is ONE
// definition of "does this part gate on min wall": measure sizes its sample budget
// by it and verify decides whether to measure it at all. Two derivations that drift
// would put a coarse reading behind a real gate, which is exactly the trap verify's
// seeding block guards against.
//
// Every function here is TOTAL. A part whose profile name is unknown, or whose
// `expect` function throws, is reported as GATED — the conservative direction, since
// that is the full-resolution behaviour every part had before budgets existed. The
// real error surfaces from verify, which is where a reader can act on it.

// `expect` may be a function of a case's resolved params, so the answer is a property
// of the EXPANDED cases, not of the raw spec — which means answering it costs a call
// to the PART'S OWN code, once per case. Both callers here are on hot paths (verify
// expands for its case loop; measure asks the gate question on every call, and verify
// calls measure once per case), so an unmemoized expansion would invoke a part's
// `expect` O(cases²) times per report. Memoized by part identity, and re-derived if
// the spec object behind that identity was swapped — the realistic mutation, and the
// one a bare WeakMap would serve staleness for.
