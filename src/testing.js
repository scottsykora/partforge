// partforge/testing — utilities for testing parts headlessly (Manifold kernel, the
// job loop, the assembly collision check, an OCCT kernel, and mesh measures).
// See docs/AUTHORING-PARTS.md "Testing a part".
//
// Most of what this re-exports is NOT test-only code: the oracle (measure/verify/
// buildView/gaps/BVH/min-wall) also runs inside the browser geometry worker, so it
// lives in src/framework/oracle/. Only the Node-bound harness — the two kernel
// booters, the PNG renderer — lives in src/testing/. This barrel is the published
// entry point and hides that split from downstream consumers.
